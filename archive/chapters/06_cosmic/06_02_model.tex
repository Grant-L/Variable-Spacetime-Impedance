\subsection{Adiabatic Cooling}
The creation of new lattice nodes is an endothermic phase transition. As the manifold grows, the energy density of radiation is diluted by the increasing volume:
\begin{equation}
    \rho_{rad} \propto \frac{1}{V(t)} \propto e^{-3H_0 t}
\end{equation}
This standard relation preserves the blackbody distribution of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), identifying it as the redshifted thermal relic of the initial lattice crystallization event.

\subsection{Resolution of the Tolman Signal}
A critical test for any cosmology is the "Surface Brightness" (Tolman) Test. In a static universe, galaxies would remain bright regardless of distance. In the Generative SVF, the insertion of new nodes mechanically spreads the photon flux over a larger area, dimming surface brightness by exactly $(1+z)^4$. This successfully aligns the Generative Model with high-precision galaxy survey data.
