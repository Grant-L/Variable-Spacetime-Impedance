\section{Theoretical Constraints on Fundamental Constants}
\label{sec:constraints}

We propose that $G$ and $\alpha$ are not arbitrary scalars but emergent geometric properties of the lattice packing. However, to avoid circular definitions, we must strictly define our independent axioms.

\subsection{Axiom III: The Vacuum Breakdown Voltage}
To define the energy scale of the lattice without assuming the Planck constant a priori, we introduce the \textbf{Vacuum Breakdown Voltage} ($V_{break}$). This is the maximum potential difference a single lattice node can sustain before dielectric breakdown (pair production).

\begin{equation}
    V_{break} \equiv \frac{c^2}{\sqrt{G \epsilon_0}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{27} \text{ Volts}
\end{equation}

While this value seems extreme, it represents the potential across a distance of $l_P$. This axiom replaces the manual insertion of $\hbar$.

\subsection{Derivation of the Planck Action ($\hbar$)}
We can now derive the Planck Action as the \textbf{Maximum Action Capacity} of a single node. The energy stored in a node at breakdown voltage is:
\begin{equation}
    E_{sat} = \frac{1}{2} C_{node} V_{break}^2
\end{equation}
Substituting $C_{node} \approx \epsilon_0 l_P$:
\begin{equation}
    \hbar \equiv E_{sat} \cdot t_{tick} = \left( \frac{1}{2} \epsilon_0 l_P V_{break}^2 \right) \left( \frac{l_P}{c} \right)
\end{equation}
This derivation identifies $\hbar$ not as a primary constant, but as the derived action limit of the capacitive substrate.

\subsection{The Gravitational Constant ($G$) as Lattice Compliance}
Having defined the energy density via $V_{break}$, we derive Gravity as the \textbf{Mechanical Compliance} (inverse stiffness) of the lattice.

The Yield Force $F_{yield}$ is the force required to displace the lattice by one pitch ($l_P$) against the saturation energy $E_{sat}$:
\begin{equation}
    F_{yield} = \frac{E_{sat}}{l_P}
\end{equation}

Equating the Lattice Stiffness to the Einstein Stiffness ($c^4/G$):
\begin{equation}
    \frac{c^4}{G} = F_{yield} \implies G = \frac{c^4 l_P}{E_{sat}}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Conclusion:} Gravity is mechanically defined as the ratio of the vacuum's slew rate ($c^4$) to its saturation energy density. A "stiffer" lattice (higher $V_{break}$) results in a weaker gravitational coupling $G$.
