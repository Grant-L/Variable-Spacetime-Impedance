\section{Simulation: The Measurement Collapse Mechanism}
\label{sec:double_slit}

The "Measurement Problem" describes the destruction of interference patterns when a particle's path is observed. In standard theory, this is treated as a metaphysical "Collapse of the Wavefunction."

In the VSI framework, Measurement is a mechanical event: the coupling of a \textbf{Detector Impedance} to the lattice.

\subsection{The Lattice Memory Effect}
As a particle (soliton) traverses the lattice, it induces a phase oscillation in the surrounding nodes (the Pilot Wave).
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Unobserved (High Impedance):} If the slits are passive voids, the phase information propagates coherently. The lattice "remembers" both paths ($U_{1} + U_{2}$), and the particle is guided by the interference gradient of its own wake.
    \item \textbf{Observed (Low Impedance):} A detector is not a passive observer; it is an active load. To register a "click," the detector must drain energy from the node.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Detector Noise Injection}
We model the detector as a \textbf{Stochastic Noise Source}. By coupling to the lattice at the slit, the detector injects random phase fluctuations ($\delta \phi_{noise}$) into the node's update cycle.

\begin{equation}
    \Psi_{total} = \Psi_{1} e^{i(\phi + \delta \phi_{noise})} + \Psi_{2}
\end{equation}

Because $\delta \phi_{noise}$ is random for each particle (uncorrelated), the time-averaged interference term vanishes:
\begin{equation}
    \langle I \rangle \propto \langle |\Psi_1 + \Psi_2|^2 \rangle \approx |\Psi_1|^2 + |\Psi_2|^2
\end{equation}

(Bottom) An active detector at the slit injects Impedance Noise, scrambling the local phase. The lattice loses its "memory" of the path, and the particles impact the screen in ballistic (classical) clumps.}

\textbf{Conclusion:} "Collapse" is not a decision made by the observer. It is the \textbf{decoherence of lattice memory} caused by the active impedance of the probe. We do not "collapse" the wave; we scramble it.
