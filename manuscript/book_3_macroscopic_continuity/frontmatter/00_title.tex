This document unites microscopic knot theory with macroscopic thermodynamics, gravity, and cosmology.

\begin{abstract}
    Current theories fail to bridge the quantum and the cosmic. AVE proves they are the same fundamental continuous fluid mechanism acting at different scales.
    
    \textbf{Volume III: Macroscopic Continuity} eliminates the abstract "curved spacetime manifold" of General Relativity, replacing it explicitly with the macroscopic structural scalar impedance gradient ($Z$) of the LC network. By formally redefining the Stress-Energy Tensor as a purely acoustic fluid state:
    \begin{equation}
        T_{\mu\nu} = (\rho + P)u_\mu u_\nu + P \eta_{\mu\nu}
    \end{equation}
    this text analytically derives Gravity, Thermodynamic Entropy, Superconductivity, and the generative expansion limits of the universe (Dark Energy) directly from the fluid tension and latent heat dissipation of the $\mathcal{M}_A$ Condensate.
\end{abstract}
