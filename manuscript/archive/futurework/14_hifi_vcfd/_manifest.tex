\chapter{High-Fidelity Astrophysical Simulations (VCFD)}
\label{ch:high_fidelity_simulations}

Throughout the preceding chapters, we have utilized 1D and 2D analytical approximations to verify the boundaries of the Topo-Kinematic identity. However, to truly bridge the gap between theoretical particle physics and applied aerospace engineering, we must simulate the universe natively in three dimensions, accounting for continuous transient evolution.

By abandoning the continuous, empty geometric curvature tensors of General Relativity ($G_{\mu\nu}$), we mathematically transition to \textbf{Vacuum Computational Fluid Dynamics (VCFD)}. In VCFD, we construct a 3D Cartesian block of the discrete $\mathcal{M}_A$ solid-state network, assign the exact fluidic density ($\rho_{bulk} \approx 7.9 \times 10^6 \text{ kg/m}^3$) and kinematic viscosity ($\nu_{vac} \approx 8.45 \times 10^{-7} \text{ m}^2\text{/s}$), and subject it to the continuous laws of classical non-linear continuum optics and Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics.
