\chapter{Demystifying Quantum Mechanics: The Transmission Line Model}
\label{ch:demystifying_qm}

For nearly a century, the "Copenhagen Interpretation" of Quantum Mechanics has dominated theoretical physics, demanding that humanity accept a universe governed by fundamental randomness, "spooky action at a distance," and overlapping probabilities. 

The Applied Vacuum Engineering (AVE) framework violently rejects this metaphysical surrender. If the spatial vacuum is a deterministic, discrete $\mathcal{M}_A$ hardware graph governed by classical continuous fluidics and solid-state elastodynamics, then the "spooky" paradoxes of Quantum Mechanics must be mathematically reducible to classical Radio Frequency (RF) and Mechanical Transmission Line effects.
