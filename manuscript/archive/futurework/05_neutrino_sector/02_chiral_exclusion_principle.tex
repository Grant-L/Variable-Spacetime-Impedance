\section{The Chiral Exclusion Principle (Parity Violation)}

The Standard Model contains a glaring geometric asymmetry: all experimentally observed neutrinos are strictly Left-Handed. The Right-Handed neutrino is completely ``missing.'' The AVE framework permanently abandons heuristic, abstract explanations and derives Parity Violation directly from the microrotational solid-state mechanics of the \textbf{Trace-Reversed Cosserat Solid} proven in Chapter 1.

\subsection{The Chiral Phononic Bandgap}
As rigorously derived in Chapter 1, the $\mathcal{M}_A$ substrate is not a continuous, structureless void; it is an over-braced Micropolar (Cosserat) continuum characterized by a specific couple-stress stiffness ($\frac{1}{3} G_{vac}$). 

We posit that the fundamental topological linkages of this trace-reversed graph possess a structural chiral bias—an intrinsic ambient macroscopic vorticity ($\Omega_{vac}$). 

In solid-state physics, transverse waves propagating through a structurally chiral lattice exhibit a strictly asymmetric dispersion relation. The wave equation for the microrotational spin of the propagating twist physically couples to this ambient Cosserat grain, taking the exact form of a generalized Klein-Gordon equation with an asymmetric chiral mass term:
\begin{equation}
    \omega^2_{L/R} = c^2 k^2 \mp \gamma_c k
\end{equation}
Where $\gamma_c$ is the intrinsic microrotational stiffness directly proportional to the $\frac{1}{3} G_{vac}$ couple-stress derived previously.

\subsection{Evanescent Localization of the Right-Handed Neutrino}
When a \textbf{Left-Handed} torsional wave ($h = -1$) propagates, the negative sign algebraically matches and slides with the intrinsic grain of the substrate. 
\begin{equation}
    \omega^2 = c^2 k^2 + \gamma_c k 
\end{equation}
The frequency squared ($\omega^2$) remains unconditionally positive, yielding a strictly real frequency. The signal propagates freely as a stable, infinite spatial wave.

However, when a \textbf{Right-Handed} torsional wave ($h = +1$) attempts to propagate, it mechanically shears \textit{against} the immense microrotational stiffness of the local lattice nodes. At the sub-microscopic spatial cutoff of a single lattice pitch ($l_{node}$), the massive $\gamma_c$ restoring torque completely overwhelms the kinetic term ($c^2 k^2$). 
\begin{equation}
    \omega^2 = c^2 k^2 - \gamma_c k < 0
\end{equation}
The frequency squared is forced strictly negative, mathematically yielding an \textbf{Imaginary Frequency}.

In discrete wave mechanics, a solution possessing an imaginary frequency is not a propagating field; it is mathematically forced to become an \textbf{Evanescent Wave}.

\textbf{Result:} The Right-Handed Neutrino is not mysteriously ``missing''; it is physically and mechanically forbidden from propagating. The Cosserat lattice immediately subjects it to catastrophic Anderson Localization, causing the right-handed wave envelope to decay exponentially to absolute zero within a single fundamental node length (see Figure \ref{fig:chiral_evanescence}). Parity Violation is not an arbitrary rule of abstract fields; it is the strict mathematical consequence of a chiral phononic bandgap within a physical discrete solid.

    \caption{\textbf{Parity Violation via Cosserat Chiral Bandgap.} Left-handed twists mathematically align with the structural grain of the Cosserat solid, yielding a real frequency ($\omega^2 > 0$) and infinite propagation. Right-handed twists violently oppose the lattice stiffness ($\frac{1}{3} G_{vac}$). At the scale of $l_{node}$, this mathematically drives $\omega^2 < 0$, natively forcing the wave into an evanescent (Anderson Localized) exponential decay.}
