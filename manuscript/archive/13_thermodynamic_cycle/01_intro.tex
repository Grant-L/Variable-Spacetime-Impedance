\section{Introduction: Beyond the Static Void}

In both Newtonian mechanics and General Relativity, the vacuum is treated as a passive stage. The Applied Vacuum Electrodynamics (AVE) framework establishes that space is a physical, discrete hardware substrate ($M_A$). 

However, a discrete lattice cannot stretch infinitely without breaking its Delaunay triangulation. Therefore, the $M_A$ lattice must exist as an emergent state ``frozen'' out of a deeper continuous medium. We model the cosmos as a \textbf{Closed Thermodynamic Engine} driven by the phase transitions of space itself.
