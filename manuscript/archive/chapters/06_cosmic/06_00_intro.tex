\section{The Generative Vacuum Hypothesis}
\label{sec:generative_intro}

Standard cosmology relies on the assumption of Metric Expansion—that space "stretches" due to a geometric scale factor $a(t)$. While this fits observational data, it lacks a mechanical driver, necessitating the addition of "Dark Energy" to explain the observed acceleration.

The \textbf{Stochastic Vacuum Framework (SVF)} proposes a hardware-based alternative: \textbf{Lattice Genesis}.

We model the vacuum not as a continuum that stretches, but as a discrete lattice that \textbf{multiplies}. Driven by the intrinsic Lattice Tension ($P_{vac}$), new nodes are continuously crystallized from the underlying substrate, inserting new volume into the manifold. This shifts the cosmological paradigm from \textit{Passive Stretching} to \textit{Active Growth}.
