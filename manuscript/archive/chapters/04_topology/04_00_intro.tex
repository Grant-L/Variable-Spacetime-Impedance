\section{Introduction: The Periodic Table of Knots}

Modern field theory often treats particles as abstract point-like excitations. \citestart The \textbf{Stochastic Vacuum Framework (SVF)} proposes a constitutive mechanical reality: fundamental particles are stable \textbf{Topological Defects} (knots) in the vacuum’s flux field\cite{1061,1062}\citeend.

\begin{axiombox}[The Prime Knot Hypothesis]
    Matter is not a substance distinct from the vacuum; it is a localized, non-linear geometric configuration of the manifold hardware itself. \citestart Every stable elementary particle corresponds to a \textbf{Prime Knot} in the flux manifold\cite{1064}\citeend.
