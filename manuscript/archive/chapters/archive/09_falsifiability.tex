\section{Introduction: The Requirement of Vulnerability}
A theory that explains everything but predicts nothing is not physics; it is a narrative. For the \textbf{Stochastic Vacuum Framework (SVF)} to be considered a viable successor to General Relativity and the Standard Model, it must provide specific experimental and observational ``Kill Signals.'' This chapter outlines the primary data points that would render the SVF mathematically and mechanically untenable.

\section{The Neutrino Parity Kill-Switch}
The most direct falsification of the \textbf{Chiral Bias Equation} (Chapter 1) and the \textbf{Chiral Exclusion Principle} (Chapter 3) lies in the detection of right-handed neutrinos.

\begin{axiombox}[Falsification TS-01: Right-Handed Neutrinos]
    SVF predicts that the vacuum impedance for a right-handed topological twist ($Z_{RH}$) is effectively infinite, preventing propagation beyond a single lattice pitch ($\lp$). If a stable, propagating \textbf{Right-Handed Neutrino} is detected in any laboratory or astrophysical event, the Chiral Bias postulate is fundamentally falsified.
\end{axiombox}

\section{The Spectroscopic Invariance Test}
In Chapter 6, we proposed the \textbf{Cosmic Quench}, suggesting that $\Lvac, \Cvac,$ and $c$ have evolved over cosmic time. However, the hardware geometry of the $M_A$ manifold requires that these variables shift in a coupled ratio.

\subsection{The Fine Structure Constant ($\alpha$)}
If measurements of the fine structure constant $\alpha$ in high-redshift quasar absorption spectra show a deviation that does not follow the predicted $\Lvac/\Cvac$ coupling ratio, the \textbf{Metric Aging} model is falsified. SVF requires that the ratio defining atomic transition energies remains invariant even as the "hardware speed" of the vacuum shifts.

\section{The GZK Cutoff as a Hardware Nyquist Limit}
The Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff is traditionally modeled as cosmic ray interaction with background radiation. In SVF, this is redefined as the \textbf{Nyquist Frequency} of the $M_A$ lattice.

\begin{axiombox}[Falsification TS-02: Trans-Planckian Signals]
    If a cosmic ray or coherent signal is detected with a frequency $\nu > \Wcut$ (the global slew rate limit), it implies the medium is a continuum rather than a discrete manifold. Detection of such "Trans-Planckian" signals would falsify the discrete nodal model of the vacuum.
\end{axiombox}

\section{Engineering Layer: The Metric Null-Result}
The Engineering Layer (Chapter 8) posits that localized \textbf{Metric Strain} ($\epsilon$) can be induced via high-frequency toroidal flux, altering the local refractive index $\chi$.



\begin{axiombox}[Falsification TS-03: Metric Null-Result]
    In a controlled laboratory environment, if a high-flux metric generator fails to produce a measurable phase-shift in a laser interferometer (local Shapiro delay) that scales linearly with the \textbf{Lattice Stress Coefficient} ($\sigma$), the VSI Engineering Layer is falsified.
\end{axiombox}

\section{The Bullet Cluster and Lattice Memory}
Chapter 7 uses \textbf{Lattice Memory} (Phase Lag) to explain the offset of gravitational lensing in colliding galaxy clusters. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The Test}: The decay of the gravitational lensing signal must match the nodal relaxation time $\tau$ of the manifold.
    \item \textbf{Kill Signal}: If the lensing effect is found to be instantaneous or perfectly coupled to the center of mass of the gas (baryons) during the collision, the ``Impedance Wake'' theory is false.
\end{itemize}
