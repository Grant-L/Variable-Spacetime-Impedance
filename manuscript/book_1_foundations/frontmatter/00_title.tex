This document establishes the mechanical and mathematical axioms of the $\mathcal{M}_A$ LC Condensate framework. 

\begin{abstract}
    Standard physics requires over 26 independent free parameters. Applied Vacuum Engineering (AVE) reconstructs the universe from exactly three physical boundaries: The Spatial Cutoff ($\ell_{node}$), the Dielectric Yield Bound ($\alpha$), and the Macroscopic Strain Vector ($G$).
    
    \textbf{Volume I: Foundations} explicitly defines the continuum architecture of the vacuum. We derive the exact macroscopic moduli from a discrete 3D LC nodal network operating under standard wave mechanics:
    \begin{equation}
        Z_0 = \sqrt{\frac{L}{C}} \quad , \quad c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon_0 \mu_0}}
    \end{equation}
    Through this foundation, we prove that Quantum Mechanics (Born Rule, Entanglement, and the Generalized Uncertainty Principle) are strictly emergent, deterministic acoustic signal dynamics acting on this substrate.
