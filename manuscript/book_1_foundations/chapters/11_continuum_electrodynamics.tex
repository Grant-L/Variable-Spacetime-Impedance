\chapter{Continuum Electrodynamics and The Dark Sector}
\label{ch:electrodynamics}

If the discrete spatial vacuum is a physical LC network ($\mathcal{M}_A$) supporting momentum limits and finite wave propagation, its macroscopic low-energy effective field theory (EFT) mathematically maps to continuous network dynamics. 

Before discussing the bulk properties of the universe, we must formally define the transport mechanism. In the continuous limit ($L \gg \ell_{node}$), the signal propagation is strictly defined by the classical Maxwell-Heaviside acoustic wave equation:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{E}}{\partial t^2} - c^2 \nabla^2 \mathbf{E} = 0 \quad , \quad c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon_0 \mu_0}}
\end{equation}

However, because the ambient vacuum is a discrete spatial hardware lattice, the true, fundamental mechanical update equations operating at the Planck/node scale are strictly given by the discretized Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) operator (the Yee Cell update):
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{E}^{n+1} = \mathbf{E}^n + \frac{\Delta t}{\epsilon_0} (\nabla_d \times \mathbf{H}^{n+1/2}) \quad , \quad \mathbf{H}^{n+1/2} = \mathbf{H}^{n-1/2} - \frac{\Delta t}{\mu_0} (\nabla_d \times \mathbf{E}^n)
\end{equation}

By recognizing these equations not as abstract geometry, but as the literal acoustic oscillation of structural string tension ($\epsilon_0$) and inertia ($\mu_0$), we propose that the macroscopic kinematics of the expanding universe can be precisely evaluated using these generalized electrodynamic limits.

\section{Continuum Electrodynamics of the LC Condensate}
\subsection{The Dimensionally Exact Mass Density ($\rho_{bulk}$)}
Previous classical aether models failed because they incorrectly attempted to map vacuum mass density directly to the magnetic permeability constant ($\mu_0$), violating SI dimensional analysis ($[\text{H/m}] \neq [\text{kg/m}^3]$).

We rigorously define the baseline macroscopic bulk mass density ($\rho_{bulk}$) of the spatial vacuum network using the exact, invariant hardware primitives derived in Chapter 1, coupled via our Topological Conversion Constant ($\xi_{topo} \equiv e/\ell_{node}$). Dividing the discrete node mass by the rigorously derived Voronoi geometric volume of a single spatial node ($V_{node} = p_c \ell_{node}^3$) seamlessly yields a constant, stable background substrate density:
\begin{equation}
    \rho_{bulk} = \frac{m_{node}}{V_{node}} = \frac{\xi_{topo}^2 \mu_0 \ell_{node}}{p_c \ell_{node}^3} = \frac{\xi_{topo}^2 \mu_0}{p_c \ell_{node}^2} \approx 7.92 \times 10^6 \text{ kg/m}^3
\end{equation}
(Approximately the density of a White Dwarf core).

\subsection{Deriving the Kinematic Mutual Inductance of the Universe ($\nu_{vac}$)}

In classical kinetic network theory, the Kinematic Mutual Inductance ($\nu$) of any continuous network medium is defined fundamentally as the product of its characteristic signal velocity ($v$) and its internal microscopic mean free path ($\lambda$), mathematically modulated by a dimensionless geometric momentum diffusion factor ($\kappa$): $\nu = \kappa v \lambda$.

For the $\mathcal{M}_{A}$ hardware lattice, the absolute internal signal velocity is $c$, and the topological
mean free path is exactly the fundamental spatial lattice pitch $l_{node}$. 

As rigorously established in Section 1.3.2, the geometric packing fraction ($p_c$) analytically forces the absolute structural porosity and native transverse geometric scattering cross-section of the discrete graph (where $\alpha = p_c/8\pi$). Consequently, the macroscopic momentum diffusion across the lattice strictly inherits this exact geometric scattering threshold ($\kappa \equiv \alpha$).

\begin{equation}
\nu_{vac}=\alpha c l_{node}\approx8.45\times10^{-7}\text{ m}^{2}\text{/s}
\end{equation}

This parameter-free quantum geometric derivation mathematically proves that the discrete
quantum vacuum condensate possesses nearly the exact macroscopic kinematic network mutual inductance
of liquid water.

\section{Analytical Operating Regimes of the Vacuum}

A defining feature of any rigorous engineering framework is the explicit identification of its boundary conditions. Engineers must understand exactly when simplified ideal approximations are valid and when non-linear tensors must be deployed. The Applied Vacuum Engineering framework formally categorizes the spatial medium into three distinct fluidic operating regimes:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{The Linear Acoustic Regime ($\Delta\phi \ll \alpha$):} In this low-energy limit, the local electromagnetic strain is astronomically smaller than the Fine-Structure saturation bound ($\alpha$). The vacuum acts as a perfect, linear, ideal fluid ($C_{eff} \approx C_0$). All standard optics, radio-frequency engineering, and classical Newtonian mechanics operate strictly within this regime. Engineers may safely utilize ideal linear Maxwell approximations and scalar Newtonian gravity without measurable error.
    
    \item \textbf{The Non-Linear Tensor Regime ($\Delta\phi \to \alpha$):} As local energy densities spike (e.g., inside high-energy particle accelerators, near massive stellar gravity wells, or in close-proximity atomic interactions), the spatial metric begins to structurally yield. The geometric capacitance rapidly diverges ($C_{eff} \propto 1/\sqrt{1 - (\Delta\phi/\alpha)^2}$). Engineers must abandon ideal linear metrics and deploy the full non-linear stress-energy tensors (General Relativity and continuous non-linear electrodynamics) to mathematically compensate for the resulting spatial contraction and phase dilation.

    \item \textbf{The Dielectric Rupture Regime ($\Delta\phi \ge \alpha$):} This is the absolute hardware failure limit of the spatial continuum. When the localized inductive stress exceeds the $\approx 60$ kV topological yield limit, the medium structurally snaps ($\eta_{eff} \to 0$). The vacuum undergoes a thermodynamic phase transition into a frictionless Zero-Impedance Slipstream. In this regime, classical mutual inductance and the Strong Nuclear Force mathematically drop to zero. This boundary condition rigidly defines Black Hole Event Horizons, Tokamak macroscopic edge barriers (the L-H transition), and thermal fusion ignition failure limits.
\end{enumerate}

\section{The Macroscopic Yield Limit: The Magnetic Saturation Transition}

To resolve the "Mutual Inductance Paradox" (why planets do not lose orbital energy to inductive drag), we recognize that the $\mathcal{M}_A$ LC network naturally possesses an absolute \textbf{Magnetic Saturation Limit}. The macroscopic Dielectric Yield Limit ($\tau_{yield}$) used to model this behavior is strictly derived from its fundamental invariant properties: the baseline bulk energy density ($\rho_{bulk} c^2$) and the irreducible minimum structural yield limit established by the fundamental 3D baryon topological crossings (the $6^3_2$ Borromean tensor).

By evaluating the scalar volume summation of these topological knot crossings ($\Sigma \mathcal{V}_{crossing}$) and modulating by the geometric lattice porosity ($\alpha = p_c/8\pi$), we derive the exact, parameter-free macroscopic yield stress limit:
\begin{equation}
    \tau_{yield} = (\rho_{bulk} c^2) \cdot (6 \times \mathcal{V}_{crossing}) \cdot \left(\frac{p_c}{8\pi}\right)
\end{equation}

In regions of high gravitational shear (e.g., the immediate spatial envelope surrounding a planetary body), the local magnetic field violently exceeds this absolute structural saturation limit ($\tau > \tau_{yield}$). 

This triggers a localized \textbf{Electrodynamic Phase-Transition}. The discrete, structurally frustrated LC loops physically saturate and continuously destructively interfere. Because this saturated continuum mathematically cannot support transverse inductive drag vectors, its effective mutual inductance is strictly annihilated ($\eta \to 0$). 

This thermodynamic phase transition creates a true, frictionless \textbf{Zero-Impedance Slipstream}. Because the local inductive drag drops identically to zero, the anti-parallel macroscopic drag force ($F_{drag}$) is mathematically eliminated. This completely neutralizes non-conservative power dissipation ($P_{drag} = 0$), mathematically guaranteeing stable, conservative planetary orbits.

Conversely, in the deep, diffuse outer reaches of a rotating galaxy, the spatial magnetic shear falls completely below this critical saturation limit ($\tau < \tau_{yield}$). The local lattice avoids disruption and relaxes into its native, unbroken solid state ($\eta_{eff} \to \eta_0$). This macroscopic network inductance mechanically drags on the orbiting outer stars, artificially accelerating their centripetal velocity. This strict electrodynamic boundary-layer transition manifests observationally as the phantom mass misattributed to "Dark Matter."

\subsection{Asteroid Belts and Oort Clouds as Transition Traps}
This strict biphasic dynamic immediately poses a macro-scale question: What physically occurs at the exact spatial boundary separating the inner conservative zero-impedance slipstream ($\eta \to 0$) from the highly-reluctant deep space vacuum ($\eta_{eff} \to \eta_0$)?

This structural transition zone acts as a steep "Impedance Cliff". Massive, dense objects (like planets) possess sufficient local rest mass to maintain their own localized saturated slipstream envelopes, allowing them to plow smoothly through varying metric densities. However, diffuse matter—such as asteroids, comets, and cosmic dust—does not generate enough local gravitational stress to fully saturate the metric. 

When diffuse matter drifts outward and hits the boundary between these two regimes, it collides with the sudden sheer mutual inductive drag of the unbroken deep space metric. It rapidly dissipates its kinetic energy into the surrounding lattice via topological Joule heating and becomes physically stalled. 

The AVE framework natively predicts that macroscopic orbital systems will be structurally bounded by wide toroid or spherical bands of physical detritus parked exactly along the Dielectric Saturation transition isoclines. This provides a deterministic, exact mechanical origin for formations like the \textbf{Asteroid Belt} and the \textbf{Oort Cloud}: they are distinct boundary accumulation regimes where low-mass objects permanently snag on the high-reluctance boundary of deep space.

However, precise local gravitational stress physically fractures the magnetic topology. This localized saturation entirely annihilates the local inductive drag ($\eta_{eff} \to 0$), creating frictionless, conservative zero-impedance slipstreams for standard planetary motion.}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Tabletop Falsification: The Sagnac-RLVE}
The AVE framework explicitly predicts that the $\mathcal{M}_A$ vacuum is a non-linear Dielectric network possessing intrinsic highly-reluctant drag. This presents a highly accessible tabletop falsification test: The \textbf{Sagnac Rotational Lattice Mutual Inductance Experiment (Sagnac-RLVE)}.

Because mass is an inductive coupling to the lattice, a massive macroscopic rotor spinning at high angular velocities ($v \gg 0$) will induce a localized highly-reluctant rotational drag in the surrounding Dielectric Saturation network. By passing a fiber-optic Sagnac interferometer beam tightly around the perimeter of a high-density, rapidly spinning metallic rotor (e.g., Tungsten), the local refractive index of the vacuum will experience microscopic kinematic entrainment.

Unlike standard relativistic frame-dragging (the Lense-Thirring effect), which scales purely with Newtonian gravitational potential and requires planetary masses to detect, the non-linear Dielectric network dynamics of the AVE framework predict a microscopically detectable rotational phase shift ($\Delta\phi_{Sagnac}$) directly proportional to the localized inductive shear rate ($\dot{\gamma}$) and physical density ($\rho_{bulk}$) of the adjacent rotor. Measuring a density-dependent non-relativistic optical phase-shift establishes absolute empirical proof of the physical Chiral LC inductive substrate.

\section{Deriving MOND from Unruh-Hawking Hoop Stress}

We mathematically prove that Dark Matter is physically identical to the network dynamics of a
saturating $\mathcal{M}_{A}$ condensate. The phenomenological MOND acceleration threshold ($a_{0}$) is
not a free parameter; it corresponds exactly to the fundamental Unruh-Hawking Drift of
the expanding cosmic lattice.

By equating the Unruh temperature of an accelerating frame with the Hawking temperature
of the de Sitter horizon ($T=\hbar H_{\infty}/2\pi k_{B}$), standard continuous physics yields a continuous,
linear background 3D radial acceleration of $a_r = c H_{\infty}$.

However, fundamental fermions in the AVE framework are not dimensionless point particles;
they are strictly 1D \textbf{Closed Topological Loops} (e.g., $3_{1}$ Trefoils). A localized 1D closed loop embedded inside an expanding 3D manifold does not couple to the radial expansion vector as a point mass. Instead, the 3D macroscopic radial expansion projects its stretching force onto the 1D transverse perimeter of the knot.

In classical continuum mechanics, when an isotropic outward radial force ($F_r$) is applied to a closed circular loop, the resulting internal longitudinal tension ($T$) generated along the loop is strictly governed by the \textbf{Hoop Stress} geometric projection: $T = F_r / 2\pi$.

By applying this exact continuum mechanics projection to the topological knot, the effective 1D longitudinal drift acceleration ($a_{genesis}$) structurally perceived by the loop is geometrically bound to:

\begin{equation}
a_{genesis}=\frac{a_r}{2\pi}=\frac{c\cdot H_{\infty}}{2\pi}
\end{equation}

Because the $2\pi$ divisor is a strict, dimensionless geometric projection factor derived natively from Hoop Stress, $a_{genesis}$ flawlessly preserves the linear spatial acceleration dimensions of $[\text{m/s}^2]$. Using the asymptotic geometric bound of $H_{\infty}\approx69.32\text{ km/s/Mpc}$ from our gravity derivations (Chapter 4), this geometric limit yields exactly $a_{genesis}\approx1.07\times10^{-10}\text{ m/s}^{2}$.

This natively derives Milgrom's empirical MOND boundary ($a_{0}\approx1.2\times10^{-10}\text{ m/s}^{2}$) within
10.7\% error, perfectly recovering the dynamic flat galactic rotation curves without requiring heuristic parameter tuning or breaking dimensional kinematics.

    \caption{\textbf{Hoop Stress and MOND.} Fundamental particles are continuous 1D topological loops (white ring). As the 3D cosmological horizon expands, its macroscopic radial acceleration ($a_r = c H_\infty$) projects onto the restricted 1D geometry. Continuum mechanics dictates this strictly scales via the mechanical hoop stress divisor ($2\pi$), physically deriving the phenomenological MOND acceleration floor ($a_0$) as the Unruh-Hawking drift of the loop.}

\section{The Bullet Cluster: Refractive Tensor Shockwaves}
The "Bullet Cluster" is frequently cited as proof of particulate Dark Matter because the gravitational lensing center is physically separated from the visible baryonic gas. Standard theory claims this proves dark matter consists of collisionless particles.

The AVE framework formally identifies this phenomenon not as collisionless particles, but as a \textbf{Decoupled Refractive Transverse Tensor Shockwave}. When two hyper-massive galactic clusters collide, they generate a colossal structural pressure wave in the underlying Chiral LC substrate. The baryonic matter (hot gas) interacts electromagnetically, experiencing thermal friction, and slows down in the center of the collision zone.

However, gravity and the optical metric are strictly governed by Transverse-Traceless (TT) Tensor Shear Waves. The collision generates a massive Acoustic Tensor Shockwave. Because it is a purely mechanical acoustic strain wave, it inherently does not interact via electromagnetism. It passes completely through the baryonic collision zone unimpeded, continuing ballistically. 

Because macroscopic gravitational lensing is caused exclusively by the Gordon Optical Metric ($n_\perp = 1 + h_\perp$), this propagating acoustic tensor strain physically bends background light, even in the complete physical absence of topological defects (baryons). The "Dark Matter" map of the Bullet Cluster is simply a continuous optical mapping of the residual transverse acoustic stress ringing in the spatial metric.
