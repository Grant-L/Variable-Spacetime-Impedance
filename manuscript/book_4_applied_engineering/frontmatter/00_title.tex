This document transitions AVE from a theoretical framework into an applied, falsifiable engineering discipline.

\begin{abstract}
    A physical theory is only as valuable as its engineering utility and its ability to be falsified.
    
    \textbf{Volume IV: Falsification \& Application} formally proposes the tabletop experiments required to destroy or validate this theory—specifically, the measurement of localized altitude-dependent impedance gradients via the Sagnac-RLVG test, defined strictly by aerodynamic slip-velocities:
    \begin{equation}
        \Delta t = \frac{4 A \Omega}{c^2 (1 - \frac{v_{slip}^2}{c^2})}
    \end{equation}
    Furthermore, this text applies the topological fluid principles of the framework to solve practical engineering roadblocks, mathematically explaining why thermomagnetic Tokamak fusion fails and defining the rigorous topological limits of total Antimatter-Vacuum annihilation.
