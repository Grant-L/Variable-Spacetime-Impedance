        Modern physics models the universe as a passive stage governed by abstract laws. Applied Vacuum Electrodynamics (AVE) redefines the universe as an active physical machine: a Discrete Amorphous Manifold ($M_{A}$) governed by hardware specifications. By postulating two fundamental limits—the Lattice Pitch ($l_{0}$) and Breakdown Voltage ($V_{0}$)—we derive the "constants" of nature not as fixed scalars, but as the emergent operating limits of the substrate.
        
        From these axioms, we derive:
        \begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{0.1em}
            \item \textbf{Quantum Mechanics:} The bandwidth limitation of a discrete signaling network (Nyquist-Shannon).
            \item \textbf{Gravity:} The refractive gradient of the lattice density ($n(r)$), derived via the Elastic Green's Function.
            \item \textbf{Matter:} Topological solitons (Knots) where the fine-structure constant ($\alpha^{-1}$) emerges from the holomorphic impedance of the trefoil geometry ($4\pi^3 + \pi^2 + \pi$).
            \item \textbf{The Dark Sector:} Dark Energy is resolved as the Latent Heat of lattice crystallization, and Dark Matter as the hydrodynamic viscosity of the vacuum fluid.
        \end{itemize}
        
        This framework is strictly falsifiable. We propose the \textbf{Rotational Lattice Viscosity Experiment (RLVE)}, which predicts a density-dependent phase shift ($\Psi > 5$) that contradicts General Relativity, providing a decisive "Kill Switch" for the theory.
