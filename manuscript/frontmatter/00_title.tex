        \vspace{0.5em}
        Current physics models the universe as a geometric abstraction. This text models it as a \textbf{machine}. \\
        \vspace{0.5em}
        By defining the vacuum not as empty space, but as a \textbf{Discrete Amorphous Manifold} with finite inductive and capacitive limits, we derive the laws of nature as hardware specifications. From this mechanical substrate, we recover General Relativity as refractive stress, Quantum Mechanics as signal processing, and Mass as the stored energy of topological defects.
