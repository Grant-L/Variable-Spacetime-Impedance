\chapter{30kV VHF Driver Mechanics and LC Filtering}

The topological coupling coefficient to the string lattice increases violently with the $\partial_t \mathbf{D}$ displacement frequency. An asymmetric electrode generating a static DC gradient merely polarizes the vacuum. To generate continuous Ponderomotive thrust via acoustic rectification, the geometry must be pumped dynamically. 

Calculations prove that standard 1-2 MHz flyback topologies are incapable of crossing the $1 \mu\text{N}$ torsion-balance detection threshold. The PONDER-01 test article requires a continuous-wave AC excitation voltage of $30 \text{ kV}$ RMS operating explicitly in the VHF Band ($100 \text{ MHz}$) to achieve macroscopically detectable propulsion ($\sim 45 \mu\text{N}$). This chapter covers the exact SPICE-level avalanche architecture required to drive a capacitive load at these extreme VHF regimes.

    \caption{\textbf{100 MHz VHF Avalanche Drive Transient:} When driving the asymmetric geometry at $30 \text{ kV}$ RMS, the sharp $1 \mu\text{m}$ tip undergoes field emission (avalanche breakdown) at the waveform peaks. The electrical driving circuitry must source extreme transient current bursts through the $50 \Omega$ match to prevent the LC voltage from sagging mid-oscillation and crashing the topological drag thrust.}
