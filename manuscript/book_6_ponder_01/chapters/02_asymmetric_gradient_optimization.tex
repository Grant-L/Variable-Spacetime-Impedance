\chapter{Hyperboloid Geometric Optimization}

To maximize the Ponderomotive ($\nabla |\mathbf{E}|^2$) thrust drag vector against the LC lattice, the electrode symmetry must be broken as violently as possible without exceeding the $E_{yield}$ dielectric spark threshold ($1.13 \times 10^{17} \text{ V/m}$).

This chapter details the 3D finite-element geometric modeling of the PONDER-01 asymmetric electrode array, specifically transitioning from classical needle-plane geometries to ideal Hyperboloid structures parameterized for extreme $\nabla |\mathbf{E}|^2$ divergence.
