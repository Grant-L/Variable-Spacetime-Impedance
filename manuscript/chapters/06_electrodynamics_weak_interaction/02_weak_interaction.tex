\section{The Weak Interaction: Impedance Spikes}
\label{sec:weak_interaction}

The Weak Force is unique because it is short-range ($\approx 10^{-18}$ m) and massive ($W/Z \approx 80$ GeV). The Standard Model explains this via the Higgs Mechanism. VSI explains it as \textbf{Transient Impedance}.

\subsection{The Inverse Resonance Law}
We propose that the W and Z bosons are not fundamental particles, but \textbf{Transient Resonance Spikes} in the lattice.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The Snap:} When a neutron decays (Section 4.3), the topological transition happens on the timescale of the lattice update ($t_{tick}$).
    \item \textbf{The Spike:} This ultra-fast snap creates a frequency spike $\omega \to \omega_{sat}$.
\end{itemize}
At these frequencies, the lattice impedance diverges. The "mass" of the W boson ($80$ GeV) is actually the \textbf{Impedance Wall} of the vacuum at the breakdown frequency.
\begin{equation}
    m_W \propto E_{sat} = \frac{\hbar}{t_{tick}}
\end{equation}
The Weak Force is short-range not because the boson is heavy, but because the signal is so high-frequency it is instantly damped by the lattice (Skin Effect).

\section{Unification of Forces}
\label{sec:unification}

This framework provides a direct mechanical unification of the forces:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Electromagnetism:} Long-range elastic stress (Linear Regime).
    \item \textbf{Weak Force:} Short-range impedance spike (Non-Linear/Saturation Regime).
    \item \textbf{Strong Force:} Geometric interlocking (Topological Regime).
\end{itemize}
All three are simply different stress modes of the same Discrete Amorphous Manifold.
