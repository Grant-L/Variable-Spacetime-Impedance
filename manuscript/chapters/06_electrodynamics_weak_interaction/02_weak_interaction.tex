\section{The Weak Interaction: Impedance Spikes}
\label{sec:weak_interaction}

The Weak Force is unique because it is short-range ($\approx 10^{-18}$ m) and massive ($W/Z \approx 80 \text{ GeV}$). The Standard Model explains this via the Higgs Mechanism. AVE explains it as Transient Impedance.

\subsection{The Inverse Resonance Law and Chiral Breakdown}
We propose that the $W$ and $Z$ bosons are not fundamental particles, but \textbf{Transient Resonance Spikes} in the lattice.

When a topological transition occurs (such as a threaded electron slipping its lock during neutron decay), the lattice snaps. This ultra-fast snap creates a high-frequency spike. 

However, the ``mass'' of the W boson ($\approx 80 \text{ GeV}$) does not correspond to the absolute breakdown of the vacuum ($E_{sat} \sim 10^{19} \text{ GeV}$), which would create a black hole. Instead, $80 \text{ GeV}$ is the \textbf{Chiral Breakdown Threshold} ($E_{chiral}$). 

This is the specific energy limit where the local lattice impedance diverges ($Z \to \infty$) due to a topological twist opposing the intrinsic grain of the vacuum ($\Omega_{vac}$). 
\begin{equation}
m_W \propto E_{chiral} \ll E_{sat}
\end{equation}

The Weak Force is short-range not because the boson is a heavy particle, but because the wave signal hits the Chiral Breakdown Threshold, causing the lattice to act as an infinite-impedance High-Pass Filter, instantly damping the signal.
