\section{Deriving the Einstein Field Equations from Elastodynamics}
\label{sec:derive_einstein_tensor}

While the Gordon Optical Metric demonstrates that a variable-density dielectric reproduces the \textit{kinematics} of curved spacetime (lensing, Shapiro delay), we must rigorously derive the \textit{dynamics}. 

\subsection{The Implosion Paradox of Cauchy Elasticity}
To support purely transverse gravitational and optical waves, classical aether models enforced MacCullagh's elastic condition ($\lambda = -\mu$). However, the bulk modulus of a standard Cauchy elastic solid is $K = \lambda + \frac{2}{3}\mu$. Substituting this condition yields $K = -\frac{1}{3}\mu$. 

A negative bulk modulus implies that the universe is thermodynamically unstable; any infinitesimal density perturbation would cause the vacuum to instantaneously implode into a singularity.

\subsection{The Rigorous Repair: Micropolar Elasticity}
To resolve this, the $\mathcal{M}_A$ substrate must be formally modeled as a \textbf{Cosserat (Micropolar) Continuum}. In a Cosserat solid, lattice nodes possess both translational displacements ($u_i$) and independent, kinematically decoupled microrotational degrees of freedom ($\theta_i$, representing spin/helicity).

The asymmetric strain tensor $\gamma_{ij}$ and the torsion-curvature tensor $\kappa_{ij}$ of the vacuum are defined as:
\begin{equation}
    \gamma_{ij} = \partial_i u_j - \epsilon_{ijk} \theta_k, \quad \kappa_{ij} = \partial_i \theta_j
\end{equation}

The strain energy density functional of the vacuum substrate becomes:
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{U}_{vac} = \frac{1}{2} \lambda (\gamma_{kk})^2 + \frac{1}{2} (\mu + \alpha_c) \gamma_{ij}\gamma_{ij} + \dots + \frac{1}{2} \gamma_c \kappa_{ij}\kappa_{ij}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda, \mu$ are the classical Lam\'e parameters governing compression/shear, and $\alpha_c, \gamma_c$ are the Cosserat rotational stiffness parameters.

\subsection{Recovering Gravity and Transverse Waves}
\textbf{Thermodynamic Resolution:} The stability of the universe requires the Bulk Modulus $K = \lambda + \frac{2}{3}\mu > 0$. We assign massive, strictly positive values to $\lambda$ and $\mu$, making the universe highly incompressible and completely thermodynamically stable against collapse. 

Because the rotational modes ($\theta_i$) are mathematically decoupled from the compressive volumetric modes, transverse waves (photons and gravitons) propagate strictly as coupled \textit{twist-shear} waves. 

Their velocity $c$ is governed primarily by the rotational stiffness $\alpha_c$ of the Cosserat solid, entirely independent of $K$. By applying d'Alembert's principle to the continuum and invoking the Trace-Reversed metric perturbation ($\bar{h}_{\mu\nu}$), the wave equation for the lattice reacting to an external stress-energy source $T_{\mu\nu}$ natively yields $-\frac{1}{2} \Box \bar{h}_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}$. This allows the $\mathcal{M}_A$ lattice to transmit pure transverse gauge bosons matching the behavior of General Relativity, while maintaining absolute thermodynamic stability.
