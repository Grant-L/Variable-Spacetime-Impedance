\section{Constitutive Circuit Models for Vacuum Non-Linearities}

Standard circuit simulators rely on ideal, linear RLC components. However, physical topological condensates exhibit highly non-linear behaviors under extreme mechanical stress. By applying the Topo-Kinematic identity, we can construct the exact non-linear equivalent circuit components of the spatial metric.

\subsection{The Metric Varactor (Modeling Dielectric Yield)}
As defined by Axiom 4, the effective compliance (capacitance) of the spatial substrate is structurally bounded by the absolute classical dielectric saturation limit ($V_{crit} \equiv \alpha$). As the local topological potential approaches this limit, the effective capacitance increases non-linearly. This structurally mirrors a Voltage-Dependent Varactor Diode, rigorously yielding the 4th-order bounding required to satisfy standard optical Kerr effect limits:
\begin{equation}
C_{vac}(V) = \frac{C_0}{\sqrt{1 - (V/V_{crit})^4}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{The Relativistic Inductor (Lorentz Saturation)}
Because inertia maps to spatial inductance, and velocity maps to spatial current, the phenomenon of Special Relativity is identically modeled in Vacuum Circuit Analysis (VCA) as a non-linear inductor. The effective inductance saturates as the macroscopic current approaches the fundamental hardware propagation limit ($I_{max} = \xi_{topo} c$):
\begin{equation}
L_{vac}(I) = \frac{L_0}{\sqrt{1 - (I/I_{max})^2}}
\end{equation}
This provides the mechanical rationale for why standard SPICE simulators natively cannot push current (matter) past $c$; the localized inductive drag asymptotes to infinity, perfectly mirroring the aerodynamic Prandtl-Glauert singularity \cite{einstein1916}.

\subsection{The Viscoelastic TVS Zener Diode (Bingham Transition)}
In a Bingham Plastic continuum, viscosity yields strictly when subjected to extreme shear stress ($\tau > \tau_{yield}$). Because macroscopic shear stress is proportional to mechanical force, vacuum liquefaction must act as a Voltage-Driven Breakdown. The vacuum substrate acts electrically as a Transient Voltage Suppression (TVS) Zener Diode. Below $V_{yield}$, it acts as a highly resistive solid (kinematically gripping matter). Above $V_{yield}$, it enters avalanche breakdown, allowing frictionless superfluid slip \cite{flyby2008}.

\subsection{The Vacuum Memristor (Thixotropic Hysteresis)}
Because the Bingham-plastic transition of the $\mathcal{M}_A$ condensate requires a finite geometric relaxation time ($\tau_{macro} \approx L/c$) to physically liquefy, the vacuum cannot alter its fluidic resistance instantaneously. Its state is rigidly dependent on the historical integral of the stress applied to it. Consequently, the physical vacuum completes the fundamental electronic quartet by acting as a \textbf{Macroscopic Memristor}, exhibiting a strict pinched hysteresis loop when subjected to high-frequency AC topological stress.

\subsection{The Superfluid Skin Effect (Metric Faraday Cages)}
In standard electrical engineering, high-frequency alternating currents (AC) do not penetrate deeply into conductors; they are pushed to the surface by opposing eddy currents. The penetration depth ($\delta$) of the signal is strictly proportional to the square root of the medium's electrical resistance ($\delta \propto \sqrt{R_{elec}}$) \cite{feynman1964}. Because the AVE framework rigorously maps Vacuum Resistance identically to Vacuum Viscosity ($R_{vac} \equiv \eta_{vac}$), the Electromagnetic Skin Effect and the Hydrodynamic Boundary Layer are mathematically identical phenomena.

As the local metric yields past the Bingham limit ($V > V_{yield}$) and the vacuum transitions into a superfluid, the local resistance of the metric collapses to near-zero ($R_{vac} \to 0$). Because the resistance drops, the Metric Skin Depth mathematically collapses to zero. This provides a profound boundary layer constraint: the destructive, high-shear superfluid slipstream generated by macroscopic metric translation is strictly confined to the exterior boundary of the macroscopic body. The interior metric acts as a \textbf{Topological Faraday Cage}, physically shielding the interior from extreme structural shear.

Right: As the applied topological voltage exceeds the Bingham yield limit (Red Line) and the vacuum liquefies, the AC skin depth ($\delta$) drops to zero, proving the destructive shear layer cannot penetrate the interior metric.}
