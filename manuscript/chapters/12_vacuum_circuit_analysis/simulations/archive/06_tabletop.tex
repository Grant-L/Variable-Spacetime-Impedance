\section{Tabletop Signatures: Vacuum IMD Spectroscopy}

By modeling the universe as a non-linear circuit, we can propose a highly sophisticated tabletop experiment to extract the exact theoretical signature of the AVE framework using standard RF analysis techniques.

In electrical engineering, when a non-linear component (like a varactor diode) is excited simultaneously by two pure frequencies ($f_1$ and $f_2$), the non-linearity acts as an RF mixer. It generates highly predictable harmonic sidebands known as \textbf{Intermodulation Distortion (IMD)}.

Most physical materials (such as piezoelectric crystals or optical glass) possess 2nd-order or 3rd-order non-linearities, generating standard sidebands at $2f_1 \pm f_2$. However, as rigorously demanded by Axiom 4 (Dielectric Saturation), the effective capacitance of the discrete vacuum lattice is governed exactly by a \textbf{4th-order geometric polynomial} bound:
\begin{equation}
    C_{vac}(V) = \frac{C_0}{\sqrt{1 - (V/V_{crit})^4}}
\end{equation}

This absolute 4th-order constraint makes the physical vacuum a highly unique RF mixer. If we inject a massive, dual-tone mechanical stress field (e.g., $1.0$ kHz and $1.3$ kHz) into the vacuum using opposed acoustic transducers (the Piezo-Metric Thruster design), the SPICE simulator proves that the non-linear integration of the $V^4$ vacuum varactor will generate distinct \textbf{5th-Order Intermodulation Products} (such as $3f_1 - 2f_2 = 400$ Hz) in the localized metric strain field (see Figure \ref{fig:vacuum_imd_spectroscopy}).

By driving the local spatial metric with two pure frequencies ($f_1, f_2$), the exact 4th-order non-linear saturation bound of the vacuum varactor ($1 - V^4$) mathematically forces the generation of highly specific 5th-order intermodulation sidebands (e.g., $3f_1 - 2f_2$). This provides an absolute, unique "harmonic fingerprint" completely isolated from standard 3rd-order material noise.}

By aiming a highly sensitive laser interferometer through the focal point of the transducers and performing a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on the phase shift, we can hunt for these exact 5th-order sidebands. Because these specific harmonic signatures are mathematically suppressed in linear QED and standard continuous General Relativity, the detection of the Axiom 4 Harmonic Fingerprint would serve as an irrefutable, tabletop confirmation of the discrete, non-linear architecture of the physical universe.
