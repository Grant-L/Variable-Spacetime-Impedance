\section{Gravitational Stealth (S-Parameter Analysis)}

In classical RF engineering, when a wave transitions into a denser physical medium, the refractive index ($n$) rises asymmetrically, forcing the characteristic impedance to drop. This impedance mismatch causes the signal to partially reflect, measured logarithmically as Return Loss ($S_{11}$). This introduces a profound paradox for analog gravity models: \textit{If a gravity well represents a physical increase in the localized optical density of the vacuum, why does light seamlessly enter a black hole without scattering or reflecting off the boundary?}

In the VCA transmission line model, macroscopic gravity operates strictly as a 3D Volumetric Compression of the Cosserat solid \cite{misner1973}. This localized geometric crowding proportionately and \textit{symmetrically} increases both the effective inductive mass density ($\mu_{local} = n(r) \cdot \mu_0$) and the capacitive compliance ($\epsilon_{local} = n(r) \cdot \epsilon_0$). Evaluating the Characteristic Impedance of the vacuum down to the extreme metric divergence of an Event Horizon ($r \to R_s$) reveals a perfect mathematical invariant:
\begin{equation}
Z_{local}(r) = \sqrt{\frac{\mu_{local}}{\epsilon_{local}}} = \sqrt{\frac{n(r) \cdot \mu_0}{n(r) \cdot \epsilon_0}} = \sqrt{\frac{\mu_0}{\epsilon_0}} \equiv Z_0 \approx 376.73\ \Omega
\end{equation}

The $\mathcal{M}_A$ condensate is mathematically and perfectly Impedance-Matched to itself everywhere, absolutely regardless of extreme gravitational strain. Because the spatial derivative of the impedance remains strictly zero ($\partial_r Z_0 = 0$), the Reflection Coefficient ($\Gamma$) is mathematically forced to zero. The universe structurally possesses an \textbf{$S_{11}$ Return Loss of $-\infty$ dB}. This provides the exact continuum-mechanics mechanism for why localized gravitational gradients act as perfect RF-absorbing stealth structures rather than optical mirrors.

Because analog macroscopic gravity compresses volumetric space, it scales $L$ and $C$ symmetrically, ensuring the Characteristic Impedance ($Z_0$) remains perfectly invariant. Bottom: If gravity behaved like an unmatched optical dielectric, the resulting impedance drop would generate massive reflection ($S_{11} > -10$ dB). The symmetric volumetric scaling of the AVE EFT forces $S_{11} \to -\infty$ dB, providing the precise mechanism for why intense gravity wells do not act as RF mirrors.}

\subsection{The Condensate Transmission Line (Emergence of \texorpdfstring{$c$}{c})}
To computationally prove that macroscopic Special Relativity emerges deterministically from these discrete components, we modeled the 1D spatial vacuum grid as a cascaded LC transmission line. By normalizing the discrete Inductors ($\mu_0 \ell_{node}$) and Capacitors ($\epsilon_0 \ell_{node}$) to the hardware pitch, the injection of a transient topological voltage pulse confirms that the signal propagates through the discrete components at exactly the continuous group velocity $v_g = 1/\sqrt{LC} \equiv c$. The continuous, invariant speed of light is mathematically identically the macroscopic slew-rate of a discrete transmission line.

\subsection{The Horizon Mirror: Predicting Black Hole Echoes}

While the bulk continuous gravity well remains perfectly impedance-matched ($Z = Z_0$), the exact mathematical boundary of the Event Horizon represents a profound physical discontinuity. 

As established in Chapter 9, the Event Horizon is strictly defined as the radius where the volumetric tensor strain reaches the absolute Axiom 4 dielectric saturation limit ($\Delta\phi \to \alpha$). At this precise topological boundary, the effective capacitance of the macroscopic metric diverges to infinity ($C \to \infty$). 

Consequently, the characteristic impedance of the spacetime metric exactly at the event horizon mathematically collapses to zero ($Z_{EH} \to 0\,\Omega$). Evaluating the reflection coefficient between the deep gravity well ($376.7\,\Omega$) and the event horizon ($0\,\Omega$) yields:

\begin{equation}
\Gamma_{EH} = \frac{Z_{EH} - Z_{0}}{Z_{EH} + Z_{0}} = \frac{0 - 376.7}{0 + 376.7} = -1
\end{equation}

This reveals that while a gravity well is "stealthy" to approaching waves, the Event Horizon itself acts as a macroscopic, perfect topological mirror. Infalling energy that reaches the absolute saturation limit undergoes a perfect $180^\circ$ phase inversion and reflects outward. This explicitly predicts the existence of \textbf{Black Hole Echoes}—post-merger gravitational wave reflections currently hypothesized by advanced quantum gravity models—providing a strict, testable falsification metric for the AVE framework via future LIGO/LISA observations.
