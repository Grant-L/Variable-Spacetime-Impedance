\section{Topological Defects as Resonant LC Solitons}

If the unperturbed spacetime condensate is modeled as a passive, linear cascaded transmission line, physical matter (Fermions) can be evaluated dynamically within the VCA framework[cite: 2131]. As established in prior chapters, a fundamental particle is a stable topological defect---a highly tensioned phase vortex permanently locked into the discrete graph structure[cite: 2132]. In classical electrical engineering, a localized, trapped electromagnetic standing wave that permanently cycles reactive energy without radiative loss is defined as a \textbf{Resonant LC Tank Circuit}[cite: 2133]. By applying the Topo-Kinematic mapping to the electron's rest mass, its equivalent localized Inductance evaluates to $L_e \equiv \xi_{topo}^{-2} m_e$[cite: 2134]. The local lattice compliance acts as the restoring capacitor ($C_e \equiv \xi_{topo}^2 k^{-1}$)[cite: 2135].

\subsection{Recovering the Virial Theorem and $E=mc^2$}
We can rigorously verify this structural mapping by evaluating the stored energy of the resonant soliton[cite: 2136]. In an ideal LC tank, the peak internal dynamic (inductive) energy is defined as $E_{mag} = \frac{1}{2} L_e I_{max}^2$[cite: 2137]. Substituting the hardware velocity limit ($I_{max} = \xi_{topo} c$) evaluates to[cite: 2138]:
\begin{equation}
E_{mag} = \frac{1}{2} (\xi_{topo}^{-2} m_e)(\xi_{topo} c)^2 = \frac{1}{2} m_e c^2
\end{equation}

This elegantly resolves the historical "4/3 Electromagnetic Mass Paradox" regarding internal Poincar\'e Stresses[cite: 2138]. In a stable LC resonant soliton, the classical Virial Theorem rigidly dictates that the capacitive (electric/strain) energy stored in the static topological twist of the core must exactly equal the inductive kinetic energy ($E_{elec} = E_{mag} = \frac{1}{2}m_e c^2$)[cite: 2139]. Summing the two isolated energy ledgers perfectly recovers $E_{total} = m_e c^2$[cite: 2140]. Einstein's mass-energy equivalence principle is mechanically and mathematically identical to the Total Stored Electrical Energy of a classical macroscopic Resonant LC Tank Circuit ringing natively within the analog vacuum metric[cite: 2141].
