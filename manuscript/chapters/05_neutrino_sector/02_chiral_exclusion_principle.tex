\section{The Chiral Exclusion Principle}
\label{sec:chiral_exclusion}

The Standard Model has a glaring asymmetry: All observed neutrinos are Left-Handed. The Right-Handed neutrino is ``missing.'' AVE explains this not as a broken symmetry, but as a Hardware Filter.

\subsection{The Impedance of Chirality}
The vacuum manifold $M_A$ has an intrinsic grain orientation ($\Omega_{vac}$). When a topological twist propagates:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Left-Handed ($h = -1$):} The twist aligns with the lattice grain. The node impedance remains at baseline $Z \approx 377 \ \Omega$. The signal propagates freely.
    \item \textbf{Right-Handed ($h = +1$):} The twist opposes the lattice grain. This conflict triggers a non-linear impedance spike: $Z_{RH} \to \infty$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The High-Pass Filter}
This ``Impedance Clamping'' prevents right-handed twists from propagating beyond a single lattice pitch ($l_P$). 

\textbf{Result:} The Right-Handed Neutrino is not ``missing''; it is Hardware Forbidden. If we ever detect a stable Right-Handed neutrino, the AVE framework is falsified (Kill Signal \#1). Parity Violation is not a law of physics; it is the Bandwidth Limitation of a chiral substrate.
