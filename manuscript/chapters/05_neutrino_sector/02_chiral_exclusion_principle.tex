\section{The Chiral Exclusion Principle}

The Standard Model contains a glaring geometric asymmetry: all experimentally observed neutrinos are Left-Handed. The Right-Handed neutrino is completely ``missing.'' The AVE framework completely abandons heuristic explanations (like macroscopic ``Venetian Blinds'') and derives Parity Violation directly from the microrotational mechanics of a \textbf{Cosserat Solid}.

\subsection{The Chiral Phononic Bandgap}

As established in Chapter 7, the $\mathcal{M}_A$ substrate is not a continuous empty void; it is a discrete Micropolar (Cosserat) continuum. We posit that the fundamental topological linkages of this graph possess a structural chiral bias---an intrinsic ambient macroscopic vorticity ($\Omega_{vac}$). 

In solid-state physics, transverse waves propagating through a chiral lattice exhibit an asymmetric dispersion relation. The wave equation for the microrotational spin ($\theta$) of the propagating twist couples to this ambient grain, taking the form of a generalized Klein-Gordon equation with a chiral mass term:

\begin{equation}
    \omega^2_{L/R} = c^2 k^2 \mp \gamma_c (k \cdot \Omega_{vac})
\end{equation}

Where $\gamma_c$ is the intrinsic microrotational stiffness of the Cosserat vacuum.

\subsection{Evanescent Localization of the Right-Handed Neutrino}

When a \textbf{Left-Handed} torsional wave ($h = -1$) propagates, the negative sign algebraically matches the intrinsic grain of the substrate. The frequency squared ($\omega^2$) remains positive, yielding a strictly real frequency. The signal propagates freely as a standard wave.

However, when a \textbf{Right-Handed} torsional wave ($h = +1$) attempts to propagate, it mechanically opposes the microrotational stiffness of the local lattice. At the spatial scale of a single lattice pitch ($l_{node}$), the massive $\gamma_c$ term overwhelms the kinetic term. The frequency squared becomes strictly negative ($\omega^2 < 0$), yielding an \textbf{Imaginary Frequency}.

In wave mechanics, a solution with an imaginary frequency is not a propagating wave; it is an \textbf{Evanescent Wave}.

\textbf{Result:} The Right-Handed Neutrino is not ``missing''; it is physically forbidden from propagating. The lattice immediately subjects it to Anderson Localization, causing the wave envelope to decay exponentially to zero within a single fundamental node length. Parity Violation is not an arbitrary law of physics; it is the strict mathematical consequence of a chiral phononic bandgap in a discrete solid.
