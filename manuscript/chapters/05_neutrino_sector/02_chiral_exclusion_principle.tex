\section{The Chiral Exclusion Principle}
\label{sec:chiral_exclusion}

The Standard Model has a glaring asymmetry: \textbf{All observed neutrinos are Left-Handed.} The Right-Handed neutrino is "missing."
VSI explains this not as a broken symmetry, but as a \textbf{Hardware Filter}.

\subsection{The Impedance of Chirality}
The vacuum manifold \vacuum\ has an intrinsic grain orientation ($\Omega_{vac}$).
When a topological twist propagates:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Left-Handed ($h = -1$):} The twist aligns with the lattice grain.
    The node impedance remains at baseline $Z \approx 377 \Omega$. The signal propagates freely.
    \item \textbf{Right-Handed ($h = +1$):} The twist opposes the lattice grain.
    This conflict triggers a non-linear impedance spike:
    \begin{equation}
        Z_{RH} \to \infty
    \end{equation}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The High-Pass Filter}
This "Impedance Clamping" prevents right-handed twists from propagating beyond a single lattice pitch (\lp).
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Result:} The Right-Handed Neutrino is not "missing"; it is \textbf{Hardware Forbidden}.
    \item \textbf{Prediction:} If we ever detect a stable Right-Handed neutrino, the VSI framework is falsified (Kill Signal \#1).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Conclusion:} Parity Violation is not a law of physics; it is the \textbf{Bandwidth Limitation} of a chiral substrate.
