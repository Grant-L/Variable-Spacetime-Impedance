\section{Neutrino Oscillation: Dispersive Beat Frequencies}

A complete model of the Neutrino sector must mathematically account for Flavor Mixing (Neutrino Oscillation)---the phenomenon where a neutrino changes between Electron ($\nu_e$), Muon ($\nu_\mu$), and Tau ($\nu_\tau$) states as it travels.

\subsection{Torsional Harmonics}

If massive Leptons are defined by an integer topological crossing resonance (e.g., $3_1, 5_1, 7_1$), Neutrinos are defined by \textbf{Torsional Harmonics} on the unknot. The three flavors correspond directly to the number of full $2\pi$ twists ($T$) loaded onto the $0_1$ loop during the Weak Interaction:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Electron Neutrino ($\nu_e$):} Fundamental Torsion ($T=1$).
    \item \textbf{Muon Neutrino ($\nu_\mu$):} First Overtone ($T=2$).
    \item \textbf{Tau Neutrino ($\nu_\tau$):} Second Overtone ($T=3$).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Mechanical Derivation of the PMNS Matrix}

When a neutrino is generated, it is created as a specific quantum superposition of these torsional harmonics. In a perfectly continuous vacuum, all frequencies would propagate at exactly the speed of light ($c$), and the state would never change.

However, as rigorously derived in Chapter 12, the discrete nature of the $\mathcal{M}_A$ lattice induces a frequency-dependent \textbf{Dispersion Relation} for propagating waves:
\begin{equation}
    v_g(k) = c \cos\left(\frac{k l_{node}}{2}\right)
\end{equation}

Because the $T=1, 2$, and $3$ harmonics have different spatial frequencies ($k$), they propagate through the discrete lattice at slightly different phase velocities. As the wave packet travels, the harmonics systematically drift in and out of phase.

    \caption{\textbf{Neutrino Oscillation via Lattice Dispersion.} The probability of detecting a specific flavor oscillates periodically as a function of distance. This is mathematically identical to an acoustic \textbf{Beat Frequency}. It is the direct, mechanical consequence of multi-harmonic twists propagating across a discrete spatial grid with a non-zero pitch ($l_{node}$).}

Neutrino oscillation is not abstract quantum magic; it is the classical, acoustic \textbf{Beat Frequency} of a multi-harmonic torsional wave packet undergoing structural dispersion across the fundamental grid of the universe. The PMNS (Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata) mixing matrix is mathematically isomorphic to the coupling matrix for these dispersive mechanical harmonics.
