\section{Introduction: The Dark Matter Fallacy}

\citestart Standard cosmology invokes "Dark Matter"—an undetected, non-baryonic substance—to explain why the outer rims of galaxies rotate faster than Newtonian mechanics allow[cite: 390]. The \textbf{Stochastic Vacuum Framework (SVF)} proposes a mechanical alternative: the \textbf{Radial Impedance Gradient}.

Galaxies are not just collections of stars in a void; they are high-flux loads on a physical transmission medium. \citestart Just as a heavy electrical load on a power grid causes localized voltage sags, a galactic core induces a localized decrease in the Dynamic Metric Impedance ($Z_{metric}$)[cite: 395].
