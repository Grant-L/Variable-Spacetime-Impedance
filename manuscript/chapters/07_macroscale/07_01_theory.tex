\section{The Radial Impedance Function}
\label{sec:radial_impedance}

We model the impedance of the vacuum as a function of the local mass density and its resulting metric strain. \citestart As one moves toward the galactic rim, the mass-loading effect diminishes, causing the vacuum to "stiffen" or return to its high-impedance ground state $Z_0$[cite: 407].

This gradient is described by:

\begin{equation}
    Z(r) = Z_{0} \exp\left(-\frac{\Phi_{total}}{r \cdot Z_{0}}\right)
    \label{eq:radial_impedance}
\end{equation}

\citestart Where $\Phi_{total}$ is the total flux displacement of the core[cite: 401]. \citestart This return to $Z_0$ increases the lattice's elastic resistance to rotation, naturally flattening the velocity curves without requiring auxiliary particles[cite: 408].
