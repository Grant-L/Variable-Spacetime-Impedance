\section{Simulation: Falsification Thresholds}
\label{sec:falsification_sim}

\citestart To visualize the boundaries of the theory, we generated a Falsification Dashboard (Figure \ref{fig:kill_switch}) using the \texttt{FalsificationDashboard} module. [cite: 1237]

    \caption{\textbf{The Universal Means Test.} (Left) The Hardware Nyquist Limit imposes a hard cutoff on particle frequency ($\omega_{sat}$). Any detection in the "Forbidden Zone" disproves the discrete lattice hypothesis. (Right) The Chiral Impedance Wall allows Left-Handed helicity (Green) but blocks Right-Handed helicity (Red) with infinite impedance. Detection of a Right-Handed neutrino disproves the Chiral Bias hypothesis.}

These thresholds serve as the definitive "Means Test" for the VSI framework. \citestart Unlike string theory, which operates at energy scales inaccessible to experimentation, SVF makes predictions that are testable with current or near-future astrophysical observatories. [cite: 1241, 1242]
