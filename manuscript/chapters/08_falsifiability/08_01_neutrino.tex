\section{The Neutrino Parity Kill-Switch}
\label{sec:neutrino_parity}

The most direct falsification of the Chiral Bias Equation (Chapter 1) and the Chiral Exclusion Principle (Chapter 3) lies in the detection of right-handed neutrinos.

The SVF predicts that the vacuum impedance for a right-handed topological twist ($Z_{RH}$) is effectively infinite due to the substrate's intrinsic orientation $\mathbf{\Omega}_{vac}$. This prevents propagation beyond a single lattice pitch ($l_P$).

\textbf{Kill Condition:} If a stable, propagating \textbf{Right-Handed Neutrino} is detected in any laboratory or astrophysical event, the Chiral Bias postulate—and the hardware origin of Parity Violation—is fundamentally falsified.
