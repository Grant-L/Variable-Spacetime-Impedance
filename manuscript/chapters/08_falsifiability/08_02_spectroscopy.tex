\section{The GZK Cutoff as a Hardware Nyquist Limit}
\label{sec:gzk_limit}

The Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff is traditionally modeled as cosmic ray interaction with background radiation. In SVF, this is redefined as the \textbf{Nyquist Frequency} of the $M_A$ lattice.

\textbf{Kill Condition:} If a cosmic ray or coherent signal is detected with a frequency $\nu > \omega_{sat}$ (the global slew rate limit), it implies the medium is a continuum rather than a discrete manifold. Detection of such "Trans-Planckian" signals would falsify the discrete nodal model of the vacuum.

\section{Engineering Layer: The Metric Null-Result}
The Engineering Layer (Chapter 7) posits that localized \textbf{Metric Strain} ($\sigma$) can be induced via high-frequency toroidal flux, altering the local refractive index $\chi$.

\textbf{Kill Condition:} In a controlled laboratory environment, if a high-flux metric generator fails to produce a measurable phase-shift in a laser interferometer (local Shapiro delay) that scales linearly with the \textbf{Lattice Stress Coefficient} ($\sigma$), the VSI Engineering Layer is falsified.
