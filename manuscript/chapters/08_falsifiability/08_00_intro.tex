\section{The Universal Kill Signals}
\label{sec:kill_signals}

The SVF is a vulnerable theory. Unlike string theory, which often operates at energy scales inaccessible to experimentation, SVF makes specific, testable predictions about the hardware limits of the vacuum. Its validity rests on the following falsification thresholds:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{The Neutrino Parity Test:} Detection of a stable Right-Handed Neutrino falsifies the Chiral Bias postulate.
    \item \textbf{The Nyquist Limit:} Detection of any signal with $\nu > \omega_{sat}$ (Trans-Planckian) proves the vacuum is a continuum, killing the discrete manifold model.
    \item \textbf{Spectroscopic Coupling:} If the fine structure constant $\alpha$ varies independently of the $L/C$ hardware ratio, the Quench model is disproved.
\end{enumerate}
