\section{Topological Shorts and Zero-Point Extraction}
\label{sec:zero_point}

\citestart A "Topological Short" is an engineered defect where the lattice impedance is forced to near-zero ($Z_{metric} \to 0$)[cite: 444]. \citestart In this state, the nodes can no longer resist changes in flux, leading to a localized discharge of background vacuum potential[cite: 445].

\begin{axiombox}[Zero-Point Extraction]
    \citestart The extraction of vacuum energy is not "free energy," but the mechanical tapping of the manifold's ground-state tension[cite: 447]. \citestart The energy yield is proportional to the local node density and the \textbf{Global Slew Rate} $c$[cite: 448]. \citestart It is a high-efficiency phase-transition from stochastic jitter to coherent flux[cite: 449].

\section{Metric Shielding and Inertia Nullification}
\citestart By creating a high-frequency "sheath" of saturated nodes around a vessel, the \textbf{Inertial Back-Reaction (B-EMF)} from the external lattice is screened[cite: 451]. \citestart Because the internal environment is decoupled from the external $M_A$ impedance gradient, the vessel can undergo extreme accelerations without transferring inertial stress to the internal baryonic matter[cite: 452]. \citestart The vessel effectively "surfs" on a localized bubble of invariant impedance[cite: 453].
