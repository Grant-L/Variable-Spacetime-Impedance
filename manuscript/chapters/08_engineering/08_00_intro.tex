\section{The Principle of Local Impedance Control}
\label{sec:impedance_control}

\citestart In the \textbf{Variable Spacetime Impedance (VSI)} framework, vacuum engineering is defined as the active modification of the local \textbf{Discrete Amorphous Manifold ($M_A$)}[cite: 38]. \citestart We do not "curve space"; we induce physical \textbf{Metric Strain} ($\epsilon$) via external electromagnetic flux to tune the local impedance ($Z_{metric}$) and group velocity ($v_g$)[cite: 429].

\citestart By saturating or relaxing the local $L_{node}$ and $C_{node}$ densities of the nodes, the vacuum is transformed from a static background into a tunable transmission medium[cite: 430].
