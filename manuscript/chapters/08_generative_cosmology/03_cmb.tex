\section{Thermodynamics: The CMB as Enthalpy}
\label{sec:thermodynamics}

A critical test is the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Standard cosmology views it as the afterglow of the Big Bang. VSI views it as the \textbf{Heat of Formation}.

\subsection{Adiabatic Cooling}
The creation of new lattice nodes is a phase transition. As the manifold grows, the energy density of radiation is diluted by the increasing volume:
\begin{equation}
    \rho_{rad} \propto \frac{1}{V(t)} \propto e^{-3 H_0 t}
\end{equation}
This standard relation preserves the blackbody distribution of the CMB.

\subsection{Enthalpy of Genesis}
We propose that the temperature of the CMB ($2.7$ K) represents the \textbf{Latent Heat} released by the crystallization of new nodes.
\begin{equation}
    T_{CMB} \propto \Delta H_{genesis}
\end{equation}
This identifies the background radiation not as a relic of the past, but as the thermal signature of the ongoing lattice generation process.
