\section{The CMB as an Asymptotic Thermal Attractor}

For the Photon Gas ledger, the latent heat expelled from the crystallizing lattice acts as a continuous thermal source term. The continuous volumetric heat injection rate is identically $\dot{q}_{in} = \rho_{latent} \dot{V}/V = 3H(t) \rho_{latent}$.

The total macroscopic time rate of change of the cosmic radiation energy density ($u_{rad}$) is governed strictly by the competition between standard adiabatic expansion cooling and this continuous latent heat injection:
\begin{equation}
    \dot{u}_{rad} = -4H(t) u_{rad} + 3H(t) \rho_{latent}
\end{equation}

By transforming the time derivative to the continuous scale factor $a(t)$ using $\dot{u}_{rad} = H(t) a \frac{du_{rad}}{da}$, the expansion rate $H(t)$ perfectly cancels out of the equation:
\begin{equation}
    a \frac{du_{rad}}{da} = -4 u_{rad} + 3\rho_{latent}
\end{equation}
Integrating this linear first-order differential equation rigorously yields the exact thermodynamic history of the universe:
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=white, colframe=black]
\begin{equation}
    u_{rad}(a) = U_{hot} \, a^{-4} + \mathbf{\frac{3}{4} \rho_{latent}}
\end{equation}
\end{tcolorbox}

\textbf{The Prevention of Heat Death:} In the early universe ($a \to 0$), the first term heavily dominates, analytically proving the universe possessed a vastly hotter past that cooled exactly according to the classical Hot Big Bang model ($a^{-4}$). The Cosmic Microwave Background ($2.7$ K) measured today is overwhelmingly dominated by the transient cooling of this primordial term.

However, as the universe expands infinitely ($a \to \infty$), the adiabatic cooling term smoothly approaches zero. The ongoing latent heat of lattice genesis permanently arrests further temperature drop, mathematically bottoming out at an \textbf{Asymptotic Thermal Floor} ($u_{rad} \to \frac{3}{4} \rho_{latent}$). 

Because the universe is actively cooling today, this latent heat floor must be identically bounded by the fundamental background Unruh-Hawking horizon temperature of the expanding causal boundary ($T_U = \hbar H_0 / 2\pi k_B \sim 10^{-30}$ K). The universe will never freeze to absolute zero; it is structurally locked into a permanent, non-zero thermal attractor state maintained by the latent exhaust of the spacetime engine (see Figure \ref{fig:cmb_thermal_attractor}).
