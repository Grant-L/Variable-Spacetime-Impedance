\section{Dark Energy Resolution: Geometric Acceleration}
\label{sec:dark_energy}

Why is the expansion accelerating? In the $\Lambda$CDM model, this requires a mysterious repulsive pressure. In Generative Cosmology, it is a mathematical inevitability of \textbf{Exponential Growth}.

If the lattice multiplies at a constant rate $R_g$, the scale factor $a(t)$ grows exponentially:
\begin{equation}
    a(t) = e^{H_0 t}
\end{equation}
The "acceleration" $\ddot{a}$ is simply the second derivative of this growth:
\begin{equation}
    \ddot{a} = H_0^2 e^{H_0 t} > 0
\end{equation}
\textbf{Result:} The universe appears to accelerate not because of Dark Energy, but because \textbf{Growth is Compound}. More space creates more space. The "Jerk" parameter ($j = \dddot{a} a / \dot{a}^3$) equals 1, which matches high-precision Supernova measurements.
