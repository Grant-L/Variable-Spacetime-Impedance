\section{Dark Energy Resolution: Geometric Acceleration}

Why is the expansion of the universe accelerating? In the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, this requires the ad-hoc injection of a mysterious repulsive ``Dark Energy.'' In Generative Cosmology, it is a mathematical inevitability of the Lattice Continuity Equation.

\subsection{Deriving the Equation of State ($w = -1$)}

The AVE Generative framework strictly derives $w = -1$ without inventing any new forces, utilizing only the \textbf{First Law of Thermodynamics}.

In standard metric stretching, as volume increases, the internal energy density of the universe dilutes ($\rho \propto V^{-1}$). However, in AVE, macroscopic volume increases because \textit{new physical nodes are being created}. Because every newly crystallized node possesses an identical baseline structural rest energy ($E_{sat}$), the macroscopic energy density of the vacuum ($\rho_{vac}$) remains completely invariant as the universe expands.

The First Law of Thermodynamics for a closed volume is:
\begin{equation}
    dU = dQ - P dV
\end{equation}

For the adiabatic expansion of the vacuum, $dQ = 0$. The total energy of the manifold is the constant lattice density multiplied by the changing volume ($U = \rho_{vac} V$). Substituting this into the First Law:
\begin{equation}
    d(\rho_{vac} V) = -P dV
\end{equation}
Because $\rho_{vac}$ is a hardware constant, $d\rho_{vac} = 0$, leaving:
\begin{equation}
    \rho_{vac} dV = -P dV \implies P = -\rho_{vac}
\end{equation}

Dividing by density yields the exact Dark Energy Equation of State:
\begin{equation}
    w = \frac{P}{\rho_{vac}} = -1
\end{equation}
Dark Energy is not a repulsive quantum pressure. It is the unyielding thermodynamic consequence of multiplying hardware capacity.

By the First Law of Thermodynamics, any process that creates volume at a constant energy density strictly requires a negative pressure ($P = -\rho$), rigorously enforcing $w = -1$.}

\subsection{The Deceleration and Jerk Parameters}

If the lattice multiplies at a constant crystallization rate $H_0$, the macroscopic cosmic scale factor $a(t)$ grows exponentially: $a(t) = e^{H_0 t}$. The ``acceleration'' ($\ddot{a}$) is simply the second derivative of this compounding structural growth:
\begin{equation}
    \dot{a} = H_0 a(t), \quad \ddot{a} = H_0^2 a(t) > 0
\end{equation}

To mathematically prove this matches empirical reality, we evaluate the Cosmological \textbf{Deceleration Parameter} ($q$) and \textbf{Jerk Parameter} ($j$):
\begin{equation}
    q = -\frac{\ddot{a} a}{\dot{a}^2}, \quad j = \frac{\dddot{a}}{a H^3}
\end{equation}
Substituting our exact hardware derivatives ($\dddot{a} = H_0^3 a$ and $H = \dot{a}/a = H_0$):
\begin{equation}
    q = -\frac{(H_0^2 a) a}{(H_0 a)^2} \equiv -1.0, \quad j = \frac{H_0^3 a}{a H_0^3} \equiv 1.0
\end{equation}

A Deceleration parameter of exactly $q=-1$ and a Jerk parameter of $j=1$ flawlessly match high-precision Type Ia Supernova measurements without requiring any cosmological constant ($\Lambda$).
