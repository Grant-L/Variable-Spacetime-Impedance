\section{The Fundamental Axioms of Vacuum Engineering}
\label{sec:axioms}

To eliminate circular definitions and reduce the universe to a mechanical substrate, this framework rests entirely on six fundamental hardware axioms. All other physics are derived as emergent behaviors of these limits.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Axiom I: The Discrete Substrate Limit ($l_P$).} The universe is a discrete, amorphous transmission network. The mean edge length between nodes is the fundamental Lattice Pitch ($l_P \approx 1.616 \times 10^{-35} \text{ m}$). 
    \item \textbf{Axiom II: The Constitutive Moduli ($\mu_0, \epsilon_0$).} Each node acts as a reactive circuit element possessing Inductance Density ($\mu_0$, resistance to flux displacement) and Capacitance Density ($\epsilon_0$, elastic charge storage). 
    \item \textbf{Axiom III: The Global Slew Rate ($c$).} The speed of light is not a geometric absolute, but the maximum signal propagation slew rate of the discrete network: $c = 1/\sqrt{\mu_0\epsilon_0}$.
    \item \textbf{Axiom IV: The Saturable Dielectric Condition.} Near breakdown ($U \approx U_{sat}$), the capacitance clamps to a maximum saturation value, localizing energy as stable topological knots (Matter).
    \item \textbf{Axiom V: The Generative Manifold ($H_0$).} Driven by intrinsic lattice tension, the continuous quantum potential underlying the graph constantly crystallizes into new discrete nodes at the Genesis Rate ($H_0 \approx 2.3 \times 10^{-18} \text{ Hz}$).
    \item \textbf{Axiom VI: The Vacuum Breakdown Voltage ($V_{break}$).} The maximum potential difference a single node can sustain before the lattice bonds rupture (pair production) is $V_{break} \equiv c^2 / \sqrt{G\epsilon_0} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{27} \text{ V}$.
