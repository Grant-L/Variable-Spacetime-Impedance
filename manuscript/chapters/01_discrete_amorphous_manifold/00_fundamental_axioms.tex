\section{The Fundamental Axioms of Vacuum Engineering}
\label{sec:axioms}

To eliminate circular definitions and reduce the universe to a mechanical substrate, the \textbf{Applied Vacuum Electrodynamics (AVE)} framework rests entirely on six fundamental hardware axioms. All other physics are derived as emergent behaviors of these limits.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Axiom I: The Discrete Substrate Limit ($l_{0}$)}. The universe is not a continuous geometry, but a discrete, amorphous transmission network. The mean edge length between nodes is the fundamental \textbf{Lattice Pitch} ($l_{0}$). This is an independent hardware primitive, empirically bounded by high-energy cosmic ray cutoffs (GZK limit) to approximately $1.6 \times 10^{-35}$ m.
    \textit{Calibration Note:} While $l_0$ aligns with the derived Planck length ($l_P = \sqrt{\hbar G/c^3}$), in AVE it is a primary input parameter of the mesh, not a secondary derivative of constants $G$ and $\hbar$.
    \item \textbf{Axiom II: The Constitutive Moduli ($\mu_{0}, \epsilon_{0}$)}. Each node acts as a reactive circuit element possessing Inductance Density ($\mu_{0}$, resistance to flux displacement) and Capacitance Density ($\epsilon_{0}$, elastic charge storage).
    \item \textbf{Axiom III: The Global Slew Rate ($c$).} The speed of light is the maximum signal propagation slew rate of the discrete network: $c = 1/\sqrt{\mu_{0}\epsilon_{0}}$.
    \item \textbf{Axiom IV: The Saturable Dielectric Condition.} Near breakdown ($U \approx U_{sat}$), the capacitance clamps to a maximum saturation value, localizing energy as stable topological knots (Matter).
    \item \textbf{Axiom V: The Generative Manifold ($H_0$).} The continuous quantum potential underlying the graph constantly crystallizes into new discrete nodes at the Genesis Rate ($H_0 \approx 2.3 \times 10^{-18} \text{ Hz}$).
    \item \textbf{Axiom VI: The Fundamental Breakdown Voltage ($V_0$).} The absolute maximum potential difference a single node can sustain before the lattice bonds rupture is an empirically anchored hardware limit: $V_0 \approx 1.04 \times 10^{27} \text{ V}$.
\end{itemize}
