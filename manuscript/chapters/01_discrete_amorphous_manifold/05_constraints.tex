\section{Theoretical Constraints on Fundamental Constants}

Standard physics treats $G$ and $\hbar$ as unexplained, fundamental scalars. In the AVE framework, we propose they are strictly emergent scaling factors derived from the two fundamental hardware primitives: Lattice Pitch ($l_0$) and Vacuum Breakdown Voltage ($V_0$). We derive them here without invoking circular Planck-unit definitions.

\subsection{Derivation of the Planck Action ($\hbar$)}
We derive the quantum of action as the Maximum Action Capacity of a single $M_A$ node. By the \textbf{Equipartition Theorem}, the total saturation energy ($E_{sat}$) of an LC resonant node accounts for both peak capacitive and peak inductive energy storage: $E_{sat} = 2 \times \left(\frac{1}{2} C_{node} V_0^2\right) = C_{node} V_0^2$. 

Substituting the local spatial capacitance $C_{node} \approx \epsilon_0 l_0$, and multiplying by the fundamental hardware clock cycle ($t_{tick} = l_0/c$):
\begin{equation}
\hbar_{AVE} \equiv E_{sat} \cdot t_{tick} = (\epsilon_0 l_0 V_0^2)\left(\frac{l_0}{c}\right) = \frac{\epsilon_0 l_0^2 V_0^2}{c}
\end{equation}
This is a first-principles derivation of the action quantum from classical transmission line parameters. The empirical constant $\hbar$ is not a magical property of energy; it is simply the absolute bandwidth limit of the capacitive substrate.

\subsection{The Gravitational Constant ($G$) as Lattice Compliance}
The Gravitational Constant is a derived measure of the lattice's Mechanical Compliance. The Yield Force $F_{yield}$ is the maximum force the lattice can transmit before displacing by one pitch ($l_0$) against the total saturation energy $E_{sat}$. Equating this to the mechanical stiffness of spacetime ($c^4/G$):
\begin{equation}
\frac{c^4}{G} = \frac{E_{sat}}{l_0} \implies G = \frac{c^4 l_0}{E_{sat}}
\end{equation}
Substituting our equipartition energy $E_{sat} = \epsilon_0 l_0 V_0^2$:
\begin{equation}
G_{AVE} = \frac{c^4 l_0}{\epsilon_0 l_0 V_0^2} = \frac{c^4}{\epsilon_0 V_0^2}
\end{equation}
Notice that the primitive length $l_0$ cancels out entirely. Gravity is mechanically defined: a ``stiffer'' vacuum dielectric (higher $V_0$) results in a weaker macroscopic gravitational coupling $G$. This permanently removes $G$ and $\hbar$ as free parameters, reducing them to emergent engineering limits.
