\section{Theoretical Constraints on Fundamental Constants}

We propose that $G$ and $\hbar$ are not arbitrary scalars, but emergent geometric properties of the lattice packing and saturation limits. To avoid circular definitions, we derive them strictly from Axiom VI ($V_{break}$).

\subsection{Derivation of the Planck Action ($\hbar$)}
We derive the Planck Action as the Maximum Action Capacity of a single node. By the \textbf{Equipartition Theorem}, the total saturation energy ($E_{sat}$) of an LC resonant node must account for both the peak capacitive and peak inductive energy storage. Therefore, $E_{sat} = E_{cap} + E_{ind} = 2 \times \left(\frac{1}{2} C_{node} V_{break}^2\right) = C_{node} V_{break}^2$. 

Substituting the local capacitance $C_{node} \approx \epsilon_0 l_P$, and multiplying by the hardware clock cycle ($t_{tick} = l_P/c$):
\begin{equation}
\hbar \equiv E_{sat} \cdot t_{tick} = (\epsilon_0 l_P V_{break}^2)\left(\frac{l_P}{c}\right) = \frac{\epsilon_0 l_P^2 V_{break}^2}{c}
\end{equation}
Because $l_P \equiv \sqrt{\hbar G/c^3}$ and $V_{break} \equiv c^2/\sqrt{G\epsilon_0}$, this resolves flawlessly ($\hbar = \hbar$). It rigorously identifies $\hbar$ not as a primary constant, but as the derived action limit of the capacitive substrate.

\subsection{The Gravitational Constant ($G$) as Lattice Compliance}
The Gravitational Constant is a derived measure of the lattice's Mechanical Compliance. The Yield Force $F_{yield}$ is the force required to displace the lattice by one pitch ($l_P$) against the total saturation energy $E_{sat}$. Equating this to the Einstein Stiffness ($c^4/G$):
\begin{equation}
\frac{c^4}{G} = \frac{E_{sat}}{l_P} \implies G = \frac{c^4 l_P}{E_{sat}}
\end{equation}
Substituting our equipartition energy $E_{sat} = \epsilon_0 l_P V_{break}^2$, we find $G = \frac{c^4}{\epsilon_0 V_{break}^2}$, perfectly recovering our Axiom VI definition of $V_{break}$. Gravity is mechanically defined: a ``stiffer'' lattice (higher $V_{break}$) results in a weaker gravitational coupling $G$.
