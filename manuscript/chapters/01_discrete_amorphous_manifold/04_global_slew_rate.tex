\section{The Global Slew Rate ($c$)}
\label{sec:slew_rate}

The speed of light is not an arbitrary relativistic speed limit; it is the \textbf{Global Slew Rate} of the underlying hardware, dictating the maximum phase velocity of state-updates between adjacent nodes.

\subsection{Derivation from Discrete to Continuous}
In any transmission line, the propagation velocity is determined strictly by the distributed inductance and capacitance. Using the discrete parameters of the graph, the maximum nodal update speed is $c = l_{node} / \sqrt{L_{node}C_{EM}}$. 

By substituting the continuous macroscopic moduli defined in Section \ref{sec:moduli}, we perfectly recover the continuous standard model wave speed:
\begin{equation}
    c = \frac{l_{node}}{\sqrt{(\mu_0 l_{node})(\epsilon_0 l_{node})}} = \frac{l_{node}}{l_{node} \sqrt{\mu_0 \epsilon_0}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0 \epsilon_0}}
\end{equation}
This derivation bridges the micro-macro gap, proving that continuous Relativity ($c$) naturally emerges from the graph's discrete hardware limitations.
