\section{State 2: Genesis as Lattice Crystallization}
\label{sec:genesis_crystallization}

Cosmic expansion (Dark Energy) is physically modeled as the \textbf{Crystallization} of this pre-geometric melt into the discrete $M_A$ lattice. Driven by innate Lattice Tension ($P_{vac}$), the continuous quantum fluid ``freezes'' into discrete nodes. The fundamental Lattice Pitch ($l_0$) is not an arbitrary constant; it is the specific atomic bond-length of this crystallization phase transition.

\subsection{The CMB as Latent Heat}
When a fluid freezes into a solid lattice, it undergoes an exothermic phase transition, releasing \textbf{Latent Heat}. As the pre-geometric fluid crystallizes into the $M_A$ lattice, it must release thermal energy into the manifold. 
\begin{equation}
\Delta Q_{genesis} = \Delta H_{cryst} \cdot \frac{dN}{dt}
\end{equation}
\textbf{Conclusion:} The Cosmic Microwave Background (2.7 K) is not a 13.8-billion-year-old Big Bang relic. It is the real-time Latent Heat of Crystallization. The vacuum glows in the microwave spectrum because new space is actively freezing into existence today in the cosmic voids.
