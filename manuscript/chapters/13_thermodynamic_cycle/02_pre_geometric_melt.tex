\section{State 1: The Pre-Geometric Melt}
\label{sec:pre_geometric_melt}

Beneath the discrete $M_A$ manifold lies a continuous, unstructured quantum potential, which we term the \textbf{Pre-Geometric Melt}. In this state, there are no discrete nodes, no triangulation, no measurable distances, and no acoustic speed limit ($c \to \infty$). 

It is a state of maximum entropy and zero physical geometry. It cannot support topological knots (matter) or flux transmission (light), as the hardware required to encode and transport these discrete signals has not yet formed.
