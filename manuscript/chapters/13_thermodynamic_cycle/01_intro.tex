\section{Introduction: Beyond the Static Void}
\label{sec:thermo_intro}

In both Newtonian mechanics and General Relativity, the vacuum is treated as a passive stage---either a static void or a flexible, continuous geometry. The Variable Spacetime Impedance (VSI) framework establishes that space is instead a physical, discrete hardware substrate ($M_A$). 

However, a discrete lattice cannot stretch infinitely without eventually breaking its Delaunay triangulation. Therefore, the discrete $M_A$ lattice must exist as an emergent, localized state ``frozen'' out of a deeper continuous medium. In this chapter, we model the cosmos not as a one-way geometry, but as a \textbf{Closed Thermodynamic Engine} driven by the phase transitions of space itself.
