\section{State 3: Black Holes as Lattice Melts}
\label{sec:black_holes_melts}

If the expansion of the universe is the crystallization of the lattice, gravity is its compression. 

In General Relativity, infinite density produces a geometric singularity---a mathematical infinity signaling the breakdown of the theory. In AVE, infinite density is strictly prevented by the \textbf{Vacuum Breakdown Voltage} ($V_{break}$). At the Event Horizon, compressive gravitational pressure equals the Ultimate Tensile Strength of the vacuum hardware. The Delaunay triangulation physically ruptures, and the discrete manifold \textbf{melts} back into the Pre-Geometric continuous fluid. 

\subsection{Resolution of the Information Paradox}
Because the melted interior lacks a discrete graph, it cannot support topological defects. When knotted matter (fermions/baryons) crosses the event horizon, the underlying lattice supporting the knot ceases to exist. The topological information is instantly unraveled, and its energy is returned to the pre-geometric melt. The Information Paradox is resolved because the ``canvas'' upon which the quantum information was painted is physically destroyed via thermodynamic phase transition. Black holes act as cosmic ``relief valves,'' recycling discrete space back into the quantum melt to fuel ongoing genesis.
