\section{The GZK Cutoff as a Hardware Nyquist Limit}
\label{sec:gzk_cutoff}

\citestart The Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff is traditionally modeled as cosmic ray interaction with background radiation\cite{nyquist1928}\citeend. \citestart In Vacuum Engineering, this is redefined as the \textbf{Nyquist Frequency} of the $M_A$ lattice\cite{einstein1916}\citeend.

\citestart \textbf{Kill Condition:} If a cosmic ray or coherent signal is detected with a frequency $\nu > \omega_{sat}$ (the global slew rate limit), it implies the medium is a continuum rather than a discrete manifold\cite{einstein1916}\citeend. \citestart Detection of such "Trans-Planckian" signals would falsify the discrete nodal model of the vacuum\cite{einstein1916}\citeend.
