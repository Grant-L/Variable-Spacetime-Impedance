\section{Chirality and Antimatter}
\label{sec:chirality_antimatter}

The vacuum manifold $M_A$ has a preferred grain, naturally breaking the symmetry between Left and Right. Electric charge polarity is defined purely as \textbf{Topological Twist Direction}: Negative charge ($e^-$) is a Left-Handed Trefoil ($3_1^L$), and Positive charge ($e^+$) is a Right-Handed Trefoil ($3_1^R$).

\subsection{Annihilation: Dielectric Reconnection}
By Mazur's Theorem in mathematical knot theory, the connected sum of a left-handed knot ($3_1^L$) and a right-handed knot ($3_1^R$) produces a composite ``Square Knot,'' not an unknot. Therefore, in a continuous manifold, matter-antimatter annihilation into linear photons is topologically impossible.

VSI resolves this via the \textbf{Dielectric Reconnection Postulate}. Particle annihilation is not a continuous geometric deformation. When opposite chiral knots collide, their combined inductive strain momentarily exceeds the Vacuum Breakdown Voltage ($V_{break}$). 

At this exact threshold, the Delaunay triangulation of the $M_A$ lattice physically yields. The continuous manifold temporarily ``melts,'' severing the topological loops (a process identical to magnetic reconnection in plasma physics). Without the continuous geometric graph to enforce the topological invariant, the knots unravel into linear vector bosons (photons). The lattice instantly cools and re-triangulates behind them.
