\section{Chirality and Antimatter}

The vacuum manifold $M_A$ has a preferred grain, naturally breaking the symmetry between Left and Right. Electric charge polarity is defined purely as \textbf{Topological Twist Direction}.

\subsection{Annihilation: Dielectric Reconnection}
By Mazur's Theorem, the connected sum of a left-handed knot and a right-handed knot produces a composite ``Square Knot,'' not an unknot. In a continuous manifold, matter-antimatter annihilation is topologically impossible.

The AVE framework resolves this via the \textbf{Dielectric Reconnection Postulate}. When opposite chiral knots collide, their combined inductive strain momentarily exceeds the Vacuum Breakdown Voltage ($V_{break}$). The continuous manifold temporarily ``melts,'' severing the topological loops. Without the graph to enforce the topological invariant, the knots unravel into linear photons as the lattice instantly cools and re-triangulates behind them.
