\section{Chirality and Antimatter}
\label{sec:antimatter}

The vacuum manifold $M_A$ has a preferred grain (defined in Chapter 1). This breaks the symmetry between Left and Right.

\subsection{Charge as Twist Direction}
We define electric charge polarity not as a scalar $+/-$, but as a **Topological Twist**:
\begin{itemize}
    \item **Negative Charge ($e^-$):** Left-Handed Trefoil ($3_1^L$).
    \item **Positive Charge ($e^+$):** Right-Handed Trefoil ($3_1^R$).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Annihilation}
When a Left-Handed knot meets a Right-Handed knot, their topologies are strictly inverse.
\begin{equation}
    3_1^L + 3_1^R \to 0_1 \text{ (Unknot)}
\end{equation}
The knots unravel into linear flux waves (Photons). This is the mechanical definition of Matter-Antimatter Annihilation.
