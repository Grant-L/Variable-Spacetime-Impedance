\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Designing the Kill Switch:}
    Design an experimental setup using a high-flux capacitor and a laser interferometer that could detect a local deviation in the refractive index $\chi$ of $10^{-9}$.

    \item \textbf{Alpha Drift:}
    If the fine structure constant $\alpha$ is found to drift by $10^{-5}$ over 10 billion years, calculate the implied rate of change for the vacuum impedance $Z_0(t)$ assuming the SVF coupled ratio holds.

    \item \textbf{The Trans-Planckian Photon:}
    Calculate the energy (in Joules) of a photon with frequency $\nu = 1.1 \omega_{sat}$. Explain why this energy density cannot be supported by the discrete lattice nodes defined in Chapter 1.
