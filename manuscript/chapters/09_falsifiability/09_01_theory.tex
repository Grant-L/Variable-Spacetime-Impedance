\section{The Neutrino Parity Kill-Switch}
\label{sec:neutrino_killswitch}

\citestart The most direct falsification of the \textbf{Chiral Bias Equation} (Chapter 1) and the \textbf{Chiral Exclusion Principle} (Chapter 3) lies in the detection of right-handed neutrinos. [cite: 1245]

\begin{axiombox}[Falsification TS-01: Right-Handed Neutrinos]
    SVF predicts that the vacuum impedance for a right-handed topological twist ($Z_{RH}$) is effectively infinite, preventing propagation beyond a single lattice pitch ($l_P$). \citestart If a stable, propagating \textbf{Right-Handed Neutrino} is detected in any laboratory or astrophysical event, the Chiral Bias postulate is fundamentally falsified. [cite: 1246, 1247]
\end{axiombox}

\section{The Spectroscopic Invariance Test}
In Chapter 6, we proposed the \textbf{Cosmic Quench}, suggesting that $L_{node}, C_{node},$ and $c$ have evolved over cosmic time. \citestart However, the hardware geometry of the $M_A$ manifold requires that these variables shift in a coupled ratio. [cite: 1248, 1249]

\begin{axiombox}[Falsification TS-02: Fine Structure Deviation]
    \citestart If measurements of the fine structure constant $\alpha$ in high-redshift quasar absorption spectra show a deviation that does not follow the predicted $L_{node}/C_{node}$ coupling ratio, the \textbf{Metric Aging} model is falsified. [cite: 1250]
