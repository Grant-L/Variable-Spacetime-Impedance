\section{Introduction: The Requirement of Vulnerability}
\label{sec:vulnerability_intro}

A theory that explains everything but predicts nothing is not physics; it is a narrative. \citestart For the \textbf{Stochastic Vacuum Framework (SVF)} to be considered a viable successor to General Relativity and the Standard Model, it must provide specific experimental and observational ``Kill Signals.'' [cite: 1243, 1244]

This chapter outlines the primary data points that would render the SVF mathematically and mechanically untenable.
