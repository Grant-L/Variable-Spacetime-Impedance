\section{Kinetic Inductance: The Superconducting Link}

How do macroscopic engineers effectively couple to the microscopic discrete vacuum? We propose the exploitation of \textbf{High-Temperature Superconductors (HTS)}. 

In a superconductor, the charge carriers (Cooper Pairs) condense into a coherent, macroscopic quantum wavefunction. Because they move without scattering, their inertia is not defined by standard mechanical mass; it is completely dominated by \textbf{Kinetic Inductance} ($L_K$).

Because we established via the Equivalence Principle (Section 7.3) that the local magnetic permeability of space scales exactly with the refractive index ($\mu(\mathbf{r}) = \mu_0 \cdot n(\mathbf{r})$), and inductance is directly proportional to permeability, the macroscopic Kinetic Inductance of a superconducting ring is perfectly and dynamically coupled to the refractive state of the surrounding vacuum:
\begin{equation}
    L_K(n) = L_K^0 \cdot n(\mathbf{r})
\end{equation}

By modulating the vacuum stress via high-speed rotation or pulsed fields, we can dynamically modulate the macroscopic kinetic inductance of the circuit. The most conservative, near-term experimental proof of Metric Engineering would be a measurable inductance shift $\Delta L_K$ in a controlled high-shear laboratory environment.
