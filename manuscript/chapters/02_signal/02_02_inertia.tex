\section{The Origin of Inertia as Back-EMF}
\label{sec:inertia}

In classical mechanics, inertia is an axiom ($F=ma$). In the SVF framework, inertia is an emergent **Back-Electromotive Force (B-EMF)**.

Because the manifold is inductive ($L_{node} \equiv \mu_0$), any attempt to change the flux state of a node (acceleration) is met with an opposing potential generated by the lattice. Inertia is simply the manifold's inductive resistance to the change in flux density associated with an accelerating topological defect.

The "Force" required to move a mass is the work required to overcome the lattice B-EMF:
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{E}_{back} = -L_{node} \frac{d\Phi}{dt}
\end{equation}
