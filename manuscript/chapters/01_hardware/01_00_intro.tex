\section{The Shift from Geometry to Hardware}

Theoretical physics has reached a juncture where the mathematical complexity of our models has outpaced our mechanical understanding of the phenomena they describe. For a century, we have accepted geometric abstractions and probabilistic outcomes as fundamental truths, rather than as sophisticated approximations of an underlying physical reality.

\textbf{Variable Spacetime Impedance: A Stochastic Vacuum Framework} is a departure from this trend. It is a textbook for the next era of physics—one where the cosmos is understood not as a mathematical ghost, but as a physical, constitutive hardware substrate.

\subsection{The Discrete Amorphous Manifold ($M_A$)}
The central thesis of this work is that the vacuum is a discrete, amorphous manifold ($M_{A}$) governed by finite inductive and capacitive densities. By redefining the fundamental constants of nature as the bulk engineering properties of this substrate, we move from a descriptive physics to an operational one.

In this framework:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Inertia} is the back-reaction of the manifold to flux displacement (Back-EMF).
    \item \textbf{Gravity} is the refractive consequence of localized metric strain.
    \item \textbf{Mass} is an emergent state of hardware saturation within the lattice nodes.
\end{itemize}
