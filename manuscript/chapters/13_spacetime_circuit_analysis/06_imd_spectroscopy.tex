\section{Condensate IMD Spectroscopy: The Harmonic Fingerprint}

By modeling the universe as a non-linear network, we can extract the exact theoretical signature of the AVE framework using standard RF analysis techniques[cite: 2154].

\paragraph{The 4th-Order Falsification Test:}
Standard optical materials possess 2nd-order or 3rd-order non-linearities, generating standard intermodulation sidebands ($2f_1 - f_2$)[cite: 2155]. However, Axiom 4 mandates a strict 4th-order geometric saturation limit ($1 - V^4$) for the vacuum condensate[cite: 2156]. 
\begin{equation}
    C_{vac}(V) = \frac{C_0}{\sqrt{1 - (V/V_{crit})^4}}
\end{equation}

\caption{\textbf{The 4th-Order Dielectric Saturation Limit.} Unlike standard Linear QED (Dashed Black), the AVE condensate (Red) imposes a hard geometric asymptote at $V_{crit}$[cite: 2157]. This non-linear curvature is the specific source of the 5th-order intermodulation products identified in the spectroscopy simulation[cite: 2158].}

\paragraph{Predicted Signal:}
This unique constraint forces the vacuum to act as a quintic RF mixer[cite: 2158].  Simulations using the AVE-SPICE solver demonstrate that when driven by a dual-tone signal ($f_1, f_2$) at 80\% of the breakdown voltage, the vacuum generates distinct \textbf{5th-Order Intermodulation Products} (specifically $3f_1 - 2f_2$) with a power magnitude of approximately \textbf{-56 dBc}[cite: 2159].

The detection of this specific harmonic signature at high field strengths would constitute definitive experimental proof of the AVE hardware, as it is mathematically suppressed in standard linear QED[cite: 2161].
