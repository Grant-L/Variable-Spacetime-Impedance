\section{Constitutive Circuit Models for Vacuum Non-Linearities}

Standard circuit simulators rely on ideal linear RLC components. However, physical materials and fluid dynamics exhibit highly non-linear behaviors under extreme mechanical stress. By rigorously mapping mechanical properties to electrical properties via the Topo-Kinematic Identity ($V \equiv \xi_{topo}^{-1} F$), we can mathematically construct the exact non-linear components of the universe.

\subsection{1. The Metric Varactor (Modeling Dielectric Yield)}
As discussed in Chapter 3 regarding dielectric saturation, the vacuum lattice exhibits an absolute upper bound on allowable topological stress ($V_{crit} \equiv \alpha$). As the local topological potential approaches this limit, the effective compliance (capacitance) increases non-linearly. This models the threshold for spontaneous pair production and behaves exactly as an idealized \textbf{Voltage-Dependent Varactor Diode}:
\begin{equation}
    C_{vac}(V) = \frac{C_0}{\sqrt{1 - (V/V_{crit})^4}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{2. The Vacuum TVS Zener Diode (Voltage-Driven Yield)}
A critical correction to classical continuum models is the proper orientation of causal fluid dynamics. In a Bingham Plastic fluid (Chapter 9), viscosity does not yield due to high velocity (Current); it physically yields strictly when subjected to extreme \textit{Shear Stress} ($\tau > \tau_{yield}$). Because macroscopic shear stress is strictly proportional to mechanical Force, the Topo-Kinematic mapping dictates that vacuum liquefaction must be a \textbf{Voltage-Driven Breakdown}.

Therefore, the vacuum substrate acts electrically as a \textbf{Transient Voltage Suppression (TVS) Zener Diode}. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Solid Regime ($|V| < V_{yield}$):} The lattice bonds hold. The vacuum acts as a highly resistive solid ($R_{eff} = R_{solid}$), kinematically gripping accelerating matter.
    \item \textbf{Fluid Regime ($|V| \ge V_{yield}$):} The topological voltage breaks the lattice. The diode enters avalanche breakdown. The local resistance collapses ($R_{eff} \to R_{fluid}$), allowing frictionless superfluid slip.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{3. The Relativistic Inductor (Lorentz Saturation)}
Because inertia maps to inductance and velocity to current, Special Relativity is identically modeled in SCA as a non-linear inductor that saturates as current approaches the fundamental wave propagation limit ($I_{max} = \xi_{topo} c$):
\begin{equation}
    L_{vac}(I) = \frac{L_0}{\sqrt{1 - (I / I_{max})^2}}
\end{equation}
This mathematically enforces the universal speed limit natively in software, proving exactly why SPICE simulators physically cannot push vacuum current (matter) past $c$.
