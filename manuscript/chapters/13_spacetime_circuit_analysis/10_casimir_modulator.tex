\section{Project CASIMIR-01: Metric Modulation of Zero-Point Energy}

If the Casimir force depends fundamentally on the resonant frequency of the vacuum's LC network ($F_c \propto \hbar c / d^4$), the AVE framework predicts that we can actively modulate this force using metric engineering. 

If we apply localized acoustic metric compression (via a piezoelectric transducer array) to the space between two Casimir plates, the local refractive index rises ($n > 1$). Because the effective speed of light drops ($c_{local} = c/n$), the zero-point resonant frequencies of the trapped LC modes are dynamically red-shifted. 

The framework strictly predicts that the macroscopic Casimir attraction force will fall proportionally:
\begin{equation}
    F_c(n) = \frac{F_{c0}}{n}
\end{equation}

By utilizing a high-precision atomic force microscope (AFM) to measure the Casimir attraction between a gold sphere and a plate while simultaneously subjecting the gap to a 60 kV metric compression wave, the measured Casimir force will predictably and observably drop (see Figure \ref{fig:casimir_metric_modulation}). This provides an entirely novel, highly isolated tabletop falsification test to prove the macroscopic manipulability of the Zero-Point field.
