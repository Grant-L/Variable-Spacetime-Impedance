\chapter{Spacetime Circuit Analysis (Equivalent Network Models)}
\label{ch:spacetime_circuit_analysis}

A primary goal of the Applied Vacuum Engineering (AVE) framework is to build a practical, analytical bridge between theoretical physics and applied engineering. If the vacuum substrate can be modeled as an interconnected, non-linear reactive network of discrete nodes ($\mathcal{M}_A$), then the macroscopic kinematics of spacetime can be approximated using the tools of \textbf{Transient Circuit Analysis} and \textbf{Equivalent Circuit Modeling}. 

By translating physical mechanics into their lumped-element electrical equivalents, we can utilize established Electronic Design Automation (EDA) methodologies to explore complex phenomena, including inertial damping, dielectric breakdown limits, and non-linear wave propagation. We formalize this approach as \textbf{Spacetime Circuit Analysis (SCA)}.
