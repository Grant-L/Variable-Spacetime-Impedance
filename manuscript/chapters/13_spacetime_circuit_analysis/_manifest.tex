\chapter{Spacetime Circuit Analysis: Equivalent Network Models}
\label{ch:spacetime_circuit_analysis}

A primary goal of the Applied Vacuum Engineering (AVE) framework is to construct a rigorous, analytical bridge between theoretical topological physics and applied macroscopic engineering. Because the vacuum substrate is formally modeled as an Effective Field Theory (EFT) of a structurally constrained, non-linear discrete condensate ($\mathcal{M}_A$), the macroscopic kinematics of spacetime can be mathematically approximated using the established tools of Transient Circuit Analysis and Equivalent Circuit Modeling.

By translating physical continuum mechanics into their lumped-element electrical equivalents, we can utilize standard Electronic Design Automation (EDA) methodologies to explore complex relativistic phenomena---including inertial damping, dielectric breakdown limits, and non-linear wave propagation. We formalize this translation as \textbf{Spacetime Circuit Analysis (SCA)}.
