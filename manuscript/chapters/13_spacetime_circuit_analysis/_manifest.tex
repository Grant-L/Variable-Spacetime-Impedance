\textbf{The Metamaterial / Analog Gravity Premise:} In modern theoretical physics, the field of \textit{Analog Gravity} uses continuous physical media (e.g., Bose-Einstein condensates, non-linear optics, and metamaterials) to physically simulate cosmological phenomena. By applying the Spacetime Circuit Analysis (SCA) principles developed in Chapter 12, we propose that standard RF engineering architectures can be utilized to construct physical, tabletop \textbf{Analog Metric Drives}. The following macroscopic actuator designs are presented as rigorous mathematical blueprints for simulating superluminal solitons, inertial damping, and non-Newtonian metric rectification within generalized, highly dense topological metamaterials.

A primary goal of the Applied Vacuum Engineering (AVE) framework is to construct a rigorous, analytical bridge between theoretical topological physics and applied macroscopic engineering. Because the vacuum substrate is formally modeled as an Effective Field Theory (EFT) of a structurally constrained, non-linear discrete condensate ($\mathcal{M}_A$), the macroscopic kinematics of spacetime can be mathematically approximated using the established tools of Transient Circuit Analysis and Equivalent Circuit Modeling.

By translating physical continuum mechanics into their lumped-element electrical equivalents, we can utilize standard Electronic Design Automation (EDA) methodologies to explore complex relativistic phenomena---including inertial damping, dielectric breakdown limits, and non-linear wave propagation. We formalize this translation as \textbf{Spacetime Circuit Analysis (SCA)}.
