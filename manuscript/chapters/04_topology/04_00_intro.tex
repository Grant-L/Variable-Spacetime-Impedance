\section{Introduction: The Periodic Table of Knots}

Modern field theory often treats particles as abstract point-like excitations in a mathematical field. The \textbf{Stochastic Vacuum Framework (SVF)} proposes a constitutive mechanical reality: fundamental particles are stable \textbf{Topological Defects} (vortices) in the vacuum’s phase field.

Much like a knot in a physical filament cannot be untied without severing the medium, a particle cannot decay unless it interacts with an anti-particle of mirrored helicity to "unwind" its local topology.

\begin{axiombox}[Matter as Topology]
    Matter is not a substance distinct from the vacuum; it is a localized, non-linear geometric configuration of the manifold hardware itself. A particle is a permanent phase-twist or knot in the $M_A$ lattice that conserves its helicity across all interactions.
