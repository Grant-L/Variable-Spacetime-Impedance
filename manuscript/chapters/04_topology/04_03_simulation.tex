\section{Simulation: Borromean Confinement}
\label{sec:borromean_sim}

To visualize the mechanical origin of the Strong Force, we modeled the phase structure of the Borromean Triad using the \texttt{ProtonTopology} module.

    \caption{\textbf{The Borromean Proton.} Three interlinked flux loops (Quarks) stabilized by mutual tension. The "Gluon Field" is physically identified as the region of high elastic stress between the rings. The topology ensures that no single quark can be isolated, perfectly reproducing the Confinement phenomenon of QCD.}
