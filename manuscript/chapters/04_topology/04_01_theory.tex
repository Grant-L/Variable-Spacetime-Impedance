\section{Helicity as Charge}
\label{sec:helicity_charge}

In Chapter 2, we identified Mass as the result of Bandwidth Saturation. Here, we identify Electric Charge ($q$) as \textbf{Topological Helicity ($h$)}. The phase $\theta$ of the vacuum potential winds around a singularity in the hardware lattice:

\begin{equation}
    q \propto \oint \nabla \theta \cdot dl = 2\pi h
    \label{eq:helicity_charge}
\end{equation}

In the discrete manifold $M_A$, the orientation of this twist relative to the global bias ($\mathbf{\Omega}_{vac}$) determines the sign of the charge. The integer $h$ represents the quantized winding state:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Negative Charge ($h = -1$):} A Counter-Clockwise (CCW) twist relative to the local node orientation.
    \item \textbf{Positive Charge ($h = +1$):} A Clockwise (CW) twist relative to the local node orientation.
\end{itemize}
