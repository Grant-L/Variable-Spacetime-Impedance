\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Winding Stability:} 
    Calculate the energy required to create a double-twist vortex ($h=2$). Show that it is energetically more efficient for the manifold to split this into two $h=1$ vortices, explaining why stable double-charged fundamental particles are not observed.

    \item \textbf{Flux Tube Tension:} 
    Using the hardware constants $L_{node}$ and $C_{node}$ from Chapter 1, estimate the tension (in Newtons) of a "Phase Bridge" connecting two nodal crossings.

    \item \textbf{The Neutrality Proof:} 
    Demonstrate that a system containing one CW twist and one CCW twist yields a net helicity of zero but maintains a non-zero local \textbf{Metric Strain} ($\epsilon$).
\end{enumerate}
