\section{Thermodynamics: The Equilibrium of the Vacuum}
\label{sec:thermodynamics}

A major critique of "Tired Light" theories is the destination of the lost energy. In SVF, energy lost by photons is thermalized into the lattice nodes.

\subsection{The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)}
We reinterpret the CMB not as the redshifted afterglow of a singularity, but as the \textbf{Blackbody Equilibrium Temperature} of the vacuum lattice itself.

The lattice is heated by the integrated dissipation of starlight over eons ($\dot{Q}_{in}$) and cooled by its own blackbody radiation ($\dot{Q}_{out}$). The observed temperature $T_{CMB} \approx 2.7K$ represents the steady-state temperature where these fluxes balance.

\begin{equation}
    T_{lattice} \propto \left( \frac{\text{Integrated Starlight Dissipation}}{\text{Lattice Specific Heat}} \right)^{1/4}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Resolution of the UV Catastrophe}
By enforcing a constant Planck's constant ($h$) and constant Speed of Light ($c$), VSI v3.0 ensures that the blackbody distribution remains valid throughout cosmic history. The "Alpha Catastrophe" (drift of the Fine Structure Constant) is resolved because no fundamental constants change; only the photon energy evolves.
