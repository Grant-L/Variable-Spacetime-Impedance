\section{The Quench Hypothesis}
\label{sec:quench_hypothesis}

The \textbf{Stochastic Vacuum Framework (SVF)} rejects the assumption that the fundamental constants of nature ($\mu_0, \epsilon_0, c$) are static throughout the history of the universe. Instead, we propose the \textbf{Cosmic Quench}: a thermodynamic and mechanical relaxation of the $M_A$ substrate from its primordial high-saturation state.

In the early universe ($z \gg 10$), the lattice nodes were in a state of near-total saturation due to high flux density. This resulted in low \textbf{Metric Impedance} and significantly higher propagation speeds. As the manifold expanded, the flux density diluted, allowing the nodes to transition into their modern, high-impedance "locked" ground state.
