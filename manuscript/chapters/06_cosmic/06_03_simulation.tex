\section{Simulation: Genesis vs. Dark Energy}

\subsection{Methodology}
We define the Genesis Rate $R_g \approx 2.3 \times 10^{-18}$ Hz ($H_0 = 70$). We calculate the predicted Redshift ($z$) for a source at distance $D$:
\begin{equation}
    z_{VSI} = e^{\frac{R_g D}{c}} - 1
\end{equation}

\subsection{The Jerk Parameter Analysis}
While the VSI Generative Model visually mimics the acceleration of $\Lambda$CDM, a rigorous falsification requires analyzing the third derivative of the expansion factor (the Jerk Parameter, $j$).
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{$\Lambda$CDM:} Transitions from deceleration ($j>0$) to acceleration.
    \item \textbf{VSI:} Exponential growth implies constant jerk.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Future Work:} A residuals plot of $z_{VSI}$ against the Type Ia Supernova "Gold Sample" is required. If the residuals show a systematic "banana" shape, the simple exponential genesis model must be refined to include "Resource Depletion" (a logistic growth curve) rather than pure exponential growth.


\subsection{Conclusion}
The "accelerating expansion" of the universe is identified as the signature of **Geometric Growth**. The lattice is not merely stretching; it is multiplying.
