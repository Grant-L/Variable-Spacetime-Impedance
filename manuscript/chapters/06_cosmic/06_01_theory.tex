\section{The Impedance Evolution Equation}
\label{sec:impedance_evolution}

We model the background Characteristic Impedance ($Z_{0}$) of the vacuum as a function of cosmic time $t$. The evolution follows a sigmoid relaxation curve, characteristic of a damped harmonic system settling into a ground state:

\begin{equation}
    Z_{0}(t) = Z_{modern} \left( 1 - e^{-\xi \cdot t} \right)
    \label{eq:impedance_evolution}
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $Z_{modern} \approx 376.73 \, \Omega$ is the current vacuum impedance.
    \item $\xi$ is the \textbf{Quench Constant}, representing the lattice relaxation rate ($s^{-1}$).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Deriving Dark Energy: The Vacuum Pressure State Equation}
Standard Cosmology attributes the accelerating expansion of the universe to a mysterious "Dark Energy." In SVF, this acceleration is identified as the mechanical release of \textbf{Latent Heat} from the vacuum phase transition.

We define the volumetric \textbf{Vacuum Energy Density} ($U_{vac}$) as the energy stored in the reactive components of the manifold. Since energy stored in a transmission line is inversely proportional to impedance for a fixed flux:
\begin{equation}
    U_{vac}(t) \propto \frac{1}{Z_0(t)}
\end{equation}

The \textbf{Vacuum Pressure} ($P_{vac}$) is the negative rate of change of this energy density:
\begin{equation}
    P_{vac}(t) = -\frac{dU_{vac}}{dt} = \frac{1}{Z_0(t)^2} \frac{dZ_0}{dt}
\end{equation}

Substituting the time derivative of Eq \ref{eq:impedance_evolution}, we obtain the \textbf{State Equation of Vacuum Pressure}:
\begin{equation}
    P_{vac}(t) \propto \frac{\xi e^{-\xi t}}{\left( 1 - e^{-\xi t} \right)^2}
    \label{eq:vacuum_pressure}
\end{equation}

This derivation reveals the mechanical origin of Dark Energy. Since $\xi > 0$, $P_{vac}$ is always positive (an outward driving force). Crucially, the function peaks when the rate of impedance change is highest relative to the absolute impedance, creating a "pulse" of acceleration that matches the onset of Dark Energy observed at $z \approx 0.7$.
