\section{The Impedance Evolution Equation}
\label{sec:impedance_evolution}

We model the background Characteristic Impedance ($Z_{0}$) of the vacuum as a function of cosmic time $t$. The evolution follows a sigmoid relaxation curve, characteristic of a damped harmonic system stiffening into its ground state:

\begin{equation}
    Z_{0}(t) = Z_{modern} \left( 1 - e^{-\xi \cdot t} \right)
\end{equation}

Where $\xi$ is the **Quench Constant** ($s^{-1}$).

\subsection{Deriving Dark Energy: The Lattice Tension State Equation}
Standard Cosmology attributes the accelerating expansion of the universe to a mysterious "Dark Energy." In SVF, this acceleration is identified as the mechanical **Lattice Tension** of the stiffening vacuum.

In General Relativity, acceleration requires a source of **Negative Pressure** ($P < 0$). We define the Vacuum Pressure $P_{vac}$ as the negative derivative of the lattice stiffness. As the manifold "cools" and $Z_0$ rises, the lattice becomes stiffer, exerting an increasing **Elastic Tension** on the fabric of spacetime:

\begin{equation}
    P_{vac}(t) = -\kappa \frac{dZ_0}{dt}
\end{equation}
Where $\kappa$ is the bulk modulus coupling constant.

Substituting the time derivative of the evolution equation:
\begin{equation}
    P_{vac}(t) \propto -\xi e^{-\xi t}
    \label{eq:vacuum_pressure}
\end{equation}

Since $P_{vac}$ is negative (Tension), it acts as a repulsive source in the Friedmann equations, driving the accelerated expansion of the universe. The "Dark Energy" epoch corresponds to the period of maximum stiffening rate ($z \approx 0.7$), where the tension overcomes the gravitational attraction of matter.
