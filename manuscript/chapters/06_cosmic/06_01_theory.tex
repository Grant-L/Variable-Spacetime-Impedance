\section{The Impedance Evolution Equation}
\label{sec:impedance_evolution}

The background \textbf{Characteristic Impedance} ($Z_0$) of the vacuum is a function of the cosmic scale factor $a(t)$. \citestart We model this evolution as a relaxation curve[cite: 1138, 1139]:

\begin{equation}
    Z_0(t) = Z_{modern} \left( 1 - e^{-\gamma / a(t)} \right)
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $Z_{modern} \approx 376.73 \, \Omega$ is the currently measured vacuum impedance.
    \citestart \item $\gamma$ is the \textbf{Quench Constant}, representing the lattice relaxation rate[cite: 1140].
\end{itemize}

\section{Variable Speed of Light and the Horizon Problem}
\citestart Because $c = 1/\sqrt{L_{node} C_{node}}$, the SVF framework naturally resolves the \textbf{Horizon Problem} without requiring the ad-hoc addition of an "Inflation" field[cite: 1141].

In the high-saturation early epoch, the slew rate of the nodes was orders of magnitude higher than the modern value. \citestart This allowed for thermal equilibrium to be established across the entire manifold before the quench "throttled" the global propagation speed to its current value[cite: 1142, 1143].
