\section{Metric Aging and Radioactive Decay}
\label{sec:metric_aging}

VSI posits that the rate of radioactive decay ($\lambda$) is not an immutable constant, but a frequency-dependent lattice response. The tunneling probability for an alpha particle depends on the "stiffness" of the vacuum barrier it must penetrate.

\begin{equation}
    \lambda(t) \propto \frac{1}{Z_{0}(t)}
    \label{eq:decay_rate}
\end{equation}

This implies that radioactive clocks (e.g., Carbon-14, Uranium-Lead) ran faster in the low-impedance past. 

\subsection{Recalibrating Chronometers}
Because $Z_0$ was lower in the past, the "ticks" of atomic clocks were compressed. Geological samples dated to billions of years ago may actually be younger when corrected for **Metric Aging**. Calibrating radiometric dates against the \textbf{Impedance Evolution Curve} (Eq \ref{eq:impedance_evolution}) is a primary requirement for reconciling SVF with geological history.
