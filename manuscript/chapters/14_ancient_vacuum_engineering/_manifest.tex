\chapter{Terrestrial Manifold Engineering: The Giza Substrate Artifact}
\label{ch:giza}

Large-scale dielectric and topological inclusions in the vacuum manifold provide testable demonstrations of AVE principles at human-engineered scales. The Giza plateau, particularly the Khafre subsystem with its hypothesized deep cylindrical shafts and cubic reservoirs, serves as a candidate macroscopic artifact. Treating observed/claimed geometries as engineered features, we derive impedance contrasts, refractive gradients, and viscous channeling consistent with lattice hardware specifications.
