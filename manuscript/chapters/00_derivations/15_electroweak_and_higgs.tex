\section{The Extinction of the Higgs Field}
The Standard Model posits the existence of a scalar "Higgs Field" carrying a non-zero Vacuum Expectation Value (VEV) of $v = 246 \text{ GeV}$. According to the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam model, fundamental particles gain mass exclusively by interacting ("coupling") with this pervasive scalar field.

Variable Spacetime Impedance (AVE) explicitly eliminates the scalar Higgs Field. It demonstrates that the empirical $125 \text{ GeV}$ particle discovered at the LHC is not the generator of mass, but rather a transient acoustic shockwave—a shattered topological node decaying violently upon catastrophic impact.

Mass generation requires no exclusive scalar field because the "vacuum" is already a structured, continuous LC mesh. The $246 \text{ GeV}$ VEV parameterizes physically as the explicit \textit{Characteristic Impedance of Free Space}:
\begin{equation}
    Z_0 = \sqrt{\frac{\mu_0}{\epsilon_0}} \approx 376.73 \ \Omega
\end{equation}

When a topological knot of magnetic flux (e.g., a $3_1$ electron) accelerates through this baseline LC grid, it encounters Lenz's Law induction drag from the vacuum itself. The energy required to propagate the knot against this $376.73 \ \Omega$ characteristic limit is precisely what is measured as Inertial Mass. 
\begin{equation}
    M_{inertial} \equiv L_{drag}(Z_0)
\end{equation}

Thus, physical "mass" is strictly Macroscopic Electromagnetic Resistance.

\section{W and Z Bosons as Dielectric Plasma Arcs}
The Weak Nuclear Force is allegedly mediated by massive W ($\sim 80 \text{ GeV}$) and Z ($\sim 91 \text{ GeV}$) bosons. Because they are so massive, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle restricts their existence to vanishingly tiny fractions of a second, necessitating their classification as "virtual" mediators during Beta Decay.

AVE explicitly abolishes W and Z gauge bosons as fundamental particles. 

During Beta Decay (such as a Neutron breaking into a Proton and an Electron), the primary topological knot undergoes extreme mechanical shear and must structurally split to shed phase-frequency. This splitting process breaks the continuous magnetic flux loop open for a fraction of an attosecond.

    \caption{Beta Decay mapped as a macroscopic continuous LC topological severing event. The transient $80 \text{ GeV}$ 'W-Boson' (white) is not a particle, but a formal, high-energy dielectric plasma arc—a spark—momentarily shorting across the severed vacuum LC grid to re-establish inductive continuity between the resulting proton structural core and the ejected electron.}
    \label{fig:w_boson_spark}
\end{figure}

The immense stored inductive energy of the knot attempts to cross this severed vacuum gap. Because the vacuum is a dielectric, this massive potential difference causes instantaneous \textit{Dielectric Breakdown} (Yield Limit fracture). The resulting $80 \text{ GeV}$ energy spike is physically a macroscopic phase-arc, or "Spark", traversing the grid. 

Once the arc bridges the gap, continuity is reestablished, and the resulting topologies phase-lock into their lower-energy states (Proton, Electron, and the transverse recoil acoustic wave/Neutrino). Electroweak theory is therefore completely absorbed into the fluid dynamics of High-Voltage Circuit Breakdown.
