\section{The Redefinition of Entropy}
In statistical mechanics, Entropy ($\Delta S$) is traditionally defined as a measure of "disorder" or "chaos" within a closed system. The Second Law of Thermodynamics dictates that entropy must always increase, providing the universe with its unidirectional "Arrow of Time." Mainstream physics often struggles to define this irreversibility mechanically, frequently falling back on information theory or the abstract statistical probability of microstates ($S = k_B \ln \Omega$).

Variable Spacetime Impedance (AVE) grounds Entropy entirely within rigorous, classical Fluid Mechanics. It eliminates "chaos" as a driving force andreplaces it with absolute geometric necessity.

\section{Geometric Scattering and Thermal Jitter}
Within the AVE framework, the vacuum is not empty; it is a dense, continuous, Cartesian mesh of Inductors and Capacitors. 

When a highly ordered, stable topological structure (such as an electron or a coherent photon wave-packet) exists, its energy is locally concentrated and phase-locked. However, when this ordered potential energy is released or structurally compromised, it cannot simply vanish. It converts into transverse, high-frequency kinetic displacement current ($d\vec{D}/dt$) waves—acoustic shocks radiating through the $377 \ \Omega$ LC grid.

Because the vacuum grid acts as a radiative medium, these waves propagate outward spherically. As the radius ($r$) of the wave-front increases, the surface area ($4\pi r^2$) grows exponentially. The finite energy of the initial event is forced to spread geometrically across an exponentially increasing number of discrete grid nodes.

The ordered vectors geometrically radiated outward, scattering their amplitudes across the Cartesian medium. The resulting state is pure transverse acoustic noise ("Heat"). The Arrow of Time is strictly the geometric irreversibility of this process.}

This continuous geometric spreading reduces the coherent macroscopic signal amplitude until it becomes indistinguishable from the background transverse vibrational noise of the LC matrix. This ambient, omnidirectional grid vibration is precisely what we measure macroscopically as \textbf{Temperature} or \textbf{Heat}.

\section{The Arrow of Time}
Entropy is therefore not a mysterious drift toward chaos; it is the physical impossibility of reversing spherical FDTD wave propagation.

For Entropy to decrease locally without applying external work, the billions of scattered, un-correlated, high-frequency transverse noise waves currently rippling outward through the vacuum would have to spontaneously, perfectly reflect off the infinite bounds of space and synchronously converge back onto a single local point at the exact same instant in time. 

The probability of this precise geometric reversal occurring naturally is effectively zero. Therefore, the "Arrow of Time" is not a time-dimension mystery; it is simply the deterministic, geometric reality that spherical wave radiation across a Cartesian grid is effectively a one-way street. Thermodynamics is fully resolved as Continuum Fluid Mechanics.
