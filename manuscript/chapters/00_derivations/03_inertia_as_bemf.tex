\section{Inertia as Back-Electromotive Force (B-EMF)}

\subsection{The Metric Flux Density Field}
To rigorously map continuum mechanics to a discrete lattice in SI units, we invoke the Topological Charge-to-Length Constant ($\xi_{topo} = e/l_{node}$). Under this topology, Inductance maps to Mass ($[L] \equiv [M]$) and Metric Current maps to Velocity ($\mathbf{I} \equiv \mathbf{v}$). 

Consequently, discrete Macroscopic Inductive Flux ($\mathbf{\Phi}_Z = L \cdot \mathbf{I}$) is mathematically isomorphic to discrete mechanical momentum ($\mathbf{p} = M \mathbf{v}$). We prove this absolute equivalence by evaluating the SI unit of magnetic flux (the Weber) carrying the $\xi_{topo}$ conversion factor:
\begin{equation}
    1 \text{ Wb} = 1 \text{ V}\cdot\text{s} = 1 \frac{\text{J}}{\text{C}}\cdot\text{s} \equiv 1 \frac{\text{J}}{(1/\xi_{topo}) \text{ m}}\cdot\text{s} = \xi_{topo} \left( \frac{\text{N}\cdot\text{m}}{\text{m}}\cdot\text{s} \right) = \xi_{topo} \left[ \text{kg}\cdot\frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}} \right]
\end{equation}
Thus, 1 Weber of magnetic flux is dimensionally identical to mechanical momentum, strictly proportional by the topological conversion constant $\xi_{topo}$ ($\mathbf{p} = \xi_{topo}^{-1} \mathbf{\Phi}_Z$). Transitioning to a continuous fluidic model, we define the Metric Flux Density Field $\mathbf{\phi}_Z$ by substituting discrete mass with continuous mass density ($\rho_{mass}$):
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{\phi}_Z(\mathbf{x},t) \equiv \rho_{mass} \mathbf{v}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Inertial Force as the Eulerian Momentum Rate}
Because the Metric Flux Density $\mathbf{\phi}_Z$ resolves to mechanical units of $[kg \cdot m^{-2} \cdot s^{-1}]$, its total time rate of change as it convects through the manifold yields an Inertial Force Density ($\mathbf{f}_{inertial}$) with strictly balanced units of $[N/m^3]$. To rigorously conserve momentum per the Reynolds Transport Theorem (Cauchy momentum equation), we must apply the Eulerian conservative form using the divergence of the flux tensor:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{f}_{inertial} = -\left( \frac{\partial \mathbf{\phi}_Z}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\mathbf{\phi}_Z \otimes \mathbf{v}) \right)
\end{equation}

To strictly recover Newton's discrete Macroscopic Inertial Force ($\mathbf{F}_{inertial}$) acting on a localized particle, we integrate this continuum force density field over the spatial volume of the particle ($V_p$):
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{F}_{inertial} = \int_{V_p} \mathbf{f}_{inertial} \, dV
\end{equation}
This rigorously bridges the gap between Newton's discrete Second Law and the continuous fluid dynamics of the $\mathcal{M}_A$ lattice, proving inertia is identically the Back-EMF of the vacuum.
