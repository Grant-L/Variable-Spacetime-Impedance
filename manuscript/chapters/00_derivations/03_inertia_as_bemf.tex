\section{Inertia as Back-Electromotive Force (B-EMF)}

\subsection{The Metric Flux Density Field}
To rigorously map continuum mechanics to a discrete lattice without assumptions, we invoke the Geometrodynamic Ansatz ($1\text{ C} \equiv 1\text{ m}$). Under this topology, Inductance maps to Mass ($L \equiv M$) and Metric Current maps to Velocity ($\mathbf{I} \equiv \mathbf{v}$). 

Consequently, discrete Macroscopic Inductive Flux ($\mathbf{\Phi}_Z = L \cdot \mathbf{I}$) is mathematically isomorphic to discrete mechanical momentum ($\mathbf{p} = M \mathbf{v}$). We can rigorously prove this dimensional absolute by evaluating the SI unit of magnetic flux (the Weber) under the Ansatz:
\begin{equation}
    1 \text{ Wb} = 1 \text{ V}\cdot\text{s} = 1 \frac{\text{J}}{\text{C}}\cdot\text{s} \xrightarrow{1\text{ C} \equiv 1\text{ m}} 1 \frac{\text{J}}{\text{m}}\cdot\text{s} = 1 \text{ N}\cdot\text{s} = 1 \text{ kg}\cdot\frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}
\end{equation}
Thus, 1 Weber of magnetic flux is dimensionally identical to 1 unit of mechanical momentum.

Transitioning to a continuous fluidic model, we define the Metric Flux Density Field $\mathbf{\phi}_Z$ permeating the manifold by substituting discrete mass with continuous mass density ($\rho_{mass}$):
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{\phi}_Z(\mathbf{x},t) \equiv \rho_{mass} \mathbf{v}
\end{equation}
This field rigorously represents the momentum density of the trapped flux knots.

\subsection{Inertial Force as the Eulerian Momentum Rate}
Because the Metric Flux Density $\mathbf{\phi}_Z$ resolves to units of $[kg \cdot m^{-2} \cdot s^{-1}]$, its total time rate of change as it convects through the manifold yields an Inertial Force Density ($\mathbf{f}_{inertial}$) with strictly balanced units of $[N/m^3]$. 

To rigorously conserve momentum for a compressible fluid density field per the Reynolds Transport Theorem (Cauchy momentum equation), we must apply the Eulerian conservative form using the divergence of the flux tensor, rather than a simple convective derivative:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{f}_{inertial} = -\left( \frac{\partial \mathbf{\phi}_Z}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\mathbf{\phi}_Z \otimes \mathbf{v}) \right)
\end{equation}

To strictly recover Newton's discrete Macroscopic Inertial Force ($\mathbf{F}_{inertial}$) acting on a localized particle in Newtons, we integrate this continuum force density field over the spatial volume of the particle ($V_p$):
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{F}_{inertial} = \int_{V_p} \mathbf{f}_{inertial} \, dV
\end{equation}
This derivation strictly bridges the gap between the localized discrete mechanics of Newton's Second Law and the continuous fluid dynamics of the $M_A$ lattice, flawlessly avoiding any calculus category errors or momentum destruction.
