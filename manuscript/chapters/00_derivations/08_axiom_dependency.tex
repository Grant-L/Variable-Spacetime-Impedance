\section{Axiomatic Dependency and Mathematical Closure}

\subsection{Proving the Absence of Circular Logic}
A frequent and valid critique of grand unified frameworks and emergent gravity theories is the risk of "syntactic tautology"—where empirical constants are circularly defined in terms of each other to force algebraic equations to balance. 

To definitively prove that the Applied Vacuum Engineering (AVE) framework possesses strict mathematical closure without phenomenological parameter tuning, we explicitly map the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of its derivations. 

\textbf{The One-Parameter Foundation:} AVE is formally established as a \textit{Rigorous One-Parameter Theory}. The entirety of the framework's predictive power is derived from exactly two geometric axioms and one empirical calibration:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Axiom 1 (Topo-Kinematic Isomorphism):} Charge is identically equal to spatial dislocation ($[Q] \equiv [L]$).
    \item \textbf{Axiom 2 (Cosserat Elasticity):} The vacuum acts as a Trace-Free Cosserat solid supporting microrotations.
    \item \textbf{Empirical Calibration:} The absolute metric scale of the lattice ($l_{node}$) is anchored identically by the fundamental fermion (the classical mass-energy limit of the electron). 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The Forward-Flow of the Framework}
From these three foundational nodes, all physical constants emerge in a strictly forward-flowing sequence:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Geometry:} The electron calibration explicitly defines the Porosity Ratio ($\alpha \approx 1/137$), which geometrically locks the volumetric packing fraction of the Delaunay graph ($\kappa_V = 8\pi\alpha$).
    \item \textbf{Electromagnetism and Inertia:} Axiom 1 yields the topological conversion constant ($\xi_{topo}$), proving that electrical resistance is physically isomorphic to the \textit{inverse} of mechanical inertial drag, and magnetic flux is exactly mapped to mechanical momentum.
    \item \textbf{The Weak Force:} The Cosserat requirement (Axiom 2) locks the bulk/shear moduli to $K=2G$. This natively forces the vacuum Poisson's ratio to $\nu_{vac} = 2/7$, which flawlessly yields the Weak Mixing Angle mass ratio ($m_W / m_Z \approx 0.8819$) without relying on arbitrary symmetry-breaking parameters.
    \item \textbf{Gravity and Cosmology:} The 1D QED tension limit ($T_{EM}$) is scaled by the cosmic hierarchy coupling ($\xi$). Projecting this 1D scalar stress into the fully isotropic 3D bulk metric of General Relativity strictly requires evaluating the Interaction Lagrangian of the trace-reversed stress-energy tensor. This mathematical evaluation of the GR action principle natively yields the $1/7$ tensor projection factor (derived exclusively from the GR trace-reversal metric operator and $\nu_{vac}$). This flawless boundary reduction yields Newton's $G$. We acknowledge the linear dependency between $G$ and $H_0$; AVE resolves the Hubble Tension by formally closing the \textbf{Dirac Constraint Triangle}, predicting $H_0 \approx 69.32$ km/s/Mpc purely from empirical $G$ and local quantum constants.
    \item \textbf{Thermodynamics:} The constant packing fraction ($\kappa_V$) geometrically forbids the lattice from storing excess expansion energy, forcing the 100\% efficient ejection of latent heat. This guarantees an open-system thermodynamic phase transition, natively yielding a Stable Phantom Dark Energy ($w_{vac} \approx -1.0001$) prevented from undergoing a Big Rip by the Cosmic Microwave Background thermal attractor. 
\end{itemize}

Because information flows exclusively outward from the geometric topology to the macroscopic observables—without ever looping an output back into an unconstrained input—the AVE framework is formally proven to be mathematically closed, highly falsifiable, and free of arbitrary phenomenological hidden variables.
