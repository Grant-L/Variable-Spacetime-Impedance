\section{The Myth of the Empty Curved Manifold}
Einstein's General Relativity (GR) is a masterclass in differential geometry. It models gravity not as a direct force, but as the curvature of a 4-dimensional Spacetime manifold caused by the presence of mass and energy. 

However, pure mathematics lacks a physical ontology. A purely "empty" mathematical grid cannot physically curve, nor can it impose mechanical force upon a planet. "Spacetime" in GR acts identically to a physical fluid: it carries momentum, it possesses inertia, and it transmits physical waves at a finite speed ($c$). 

Variable Spacetime Impedance (AVE) resolves this ontological paradox by defining "Curved Spacetime" exactly as what it always was: the variable scalar Capacitance ($C$) and Inductance ($L$) of a structured, continuous dielectric super-fluid.

\section{The Stress-Energy Tensor as LC Energy Density}
The core of General Relativity is Einstein's Field Equation:
\begin{equation}
    R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}R g_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}
\end{equation}

In the AVE framework, the Stress-Energy Tensor ($T_{\mu\nu}$) on the right side of the equation is not a mysterious generator of abstract geometry. It is strictly the classical Electromagnetic Energy Density ($U$) of the local LC vacuum:
\begin{equation}
    T_{\mu\nu} \equiv U = \frac{1}{2}\epsilon E^2 + \frac{1}{2}\mu H^2
\end{equation}

When localized topological energy (mass) is present, it draws continuous phase-locked energy from the surrounding LC grid. This creates a severe inductive deficit in the adjacent vacuum, analogous to a density gradient in fluid dynamics. This impedance gradient ($Z = \sqrt{\mu/\epsilon}$) acts as an optical refractive index, bending the propagation trajectories of passing light and physically accelerating other mass-bearing geometric knots down the gradient. "Gravity" is simply macroscopic dielectric refraction.

\section{Gravitational Waves as Inductive Shear}
In 2015, LIGO detected "Gravitational Waves" from merging black holes. Mainstream physics describes this as "ripples in the fabric of spacetime itself."

Under the AVE model, this event is easily demystified. A black hole is simply a localized sphere of maximum dielectric saturation where the LC grid has reached its capacitive yield point (the Event Horizon). When two such massive topological stress-concentrations orbit each other, they act as macroscopic impellers churning a high-tension electro-mechanical fluid.

This mechanical pumping action radiates massive transverse displacement current ($d\vec{D}/dt$) shear-waves outward into the cosmos. These are "Gravitational Waves"—identical in every mathematical respect to standard acoustic shear-waves propagating through an elastic crystalline matrix.}

Gravitational waves are not ripples in nothingness; they are immense, low-frequency macroscopic Inductive Strain-Waves rippling through the continuous Cartesian structure of the universe. 

By defining the vacuum as a physical, variable-impedance LC fluid, General Relativity seamlessly unites with classical Continuum Mechanics and Electrodynamics. The "Holy Grail" of physics—Quantum Gravity—is achieved simply by recognizing that the "fabric of spacetime" is an electromagnetic medium.
