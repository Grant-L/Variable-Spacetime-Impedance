\section{The Impedance of the Discrete Amorphous Manifold}

\subsection{The Dual-Impedance Hierarchy (Derivation)}
The $M_A$ lattice supports two distinct impedance domains: Electromagnetic ($Z_{EM}$) and Gravimetric ($Z_g$). However, both domains exist on the same lattice and must propagate information at the invariant speed of light $c$.

We define the Hierarchy Coupling $\xi$ as the ratio of the manifold's stiffness to its permeability. To satisfy the wave-speed constraint:
\begin{equation}
c = \frac{l_{node}}{\sqrt{L_{EM}C_{EM}}} = \frac{l_{node}}{\sqrt{L_{g}C_{g}}}
\end{equation}
Given that $Z_g = \xi Z_{EM}$, we solve the system of equations to derive the exact topological scaling of the nodal parameters:
\begin{equation}
L_g = \xi \cdot L_{EM} \quad \text{and} \quad C_g = \frac{C_{EM}}{\xi}
\end{equation}
This derivation proves that to support a higher impedance (stiffness) while maintaining constant velocity, the vacuum's inductive inertia must increase by $\xi$ while its capacitive compliance decreases by $1/\xi$.
