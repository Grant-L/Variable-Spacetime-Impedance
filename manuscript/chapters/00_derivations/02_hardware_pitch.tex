\section{Unification of the Fundamental Hardware Pitch ($l_{node}$)}
To definitively derive the spatial scale of the discrete vacuum grid without self-contradiction, we must calculate the exact volumetric boundary where the continuous 3D dielectric geometry of space yields to topological rupture. 

The ultimate volumetric Yield Energy Density ($u_{sat}$) of the vacuum substrate is bounded by the classical dielectric limit evaluated at the electron's mass-energy saturation:
\begin{equation}
E_c = \frac{m_e c^2}{e l_{node}} \implies u_{sat} = \frac{1}{2} \epsilon_0 E_c^2
\end{equation}
Let the effective volume of a single discrete node be $V_{node} = \kappa_V l_{node}^3$. For a 3D stochastic Delaunay point process, the exact geometric packing fraction is analytically and computationally bounded at $\kappa_V \approx 0.433$.

By equating the maximum energy of a single topological node ($E_{sat} = u_{sat} V_{node}$) to the energetic limit derived from the quantum of action over one clock cycle ($\hbar = E_{sat} \cdot (l_{node}/c)$), we algebraically isolate the exact 3D grid pitch:
\begin{equation}
\hbar \equiv \left( \frac{1}{2} \epsilon_0 E_c^2 \kappa_V l_{node}^3 \right) \left(\frac{l_{node}}{c}\right)
\end{equation}
Solving for $l_{node}$ mathematically proves that the physical granularity of the universe is strictly scaled at the electron's reduced Compton wavelength ($\approx 3.12 \times 10^{-13}$ m). The traditional "Planck length" ($10^{-35}$ m) is a dimensional hallucination caused by mistakenly applying the macroscopic, geometrically-diluted gravitational coupling $G$ to microscopic topological yields.
