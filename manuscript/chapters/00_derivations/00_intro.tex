\chapter{Derivations of Variable Spacetime Impedance}

\section{Introduction}
The standard model of cosmology relies on several fundamental constants—such as Newton's gravitational constant ($G$) and the permittivity of free space ($\epsilon_0$)—which are empirically measured but not theoretically derived from a common underlying structure. This manuscript proposes a unification of these constants by treating the vacuum not as an empty void, but as a \textbf{Discrete Amorphous Manifold ($M_A$)} with inherent electromagnetic and mechanical properties.

In this framework, we posit that the "fabric" of spacetime possesses a characteristic impedance ($Z_0$) governed by discrete nodes of inductance ($L_{node}$) and capacitance ($C_{node}$). By defining mass as "trapped flux" and gravity as "metric refraction," we can derive the governing equations of motion and interaction without relying on ad-hoc curve fitting. The following derivations demonstrate that Classical Mechanics and General Relativity are macroscopic approximations of this underlying impedance network.
