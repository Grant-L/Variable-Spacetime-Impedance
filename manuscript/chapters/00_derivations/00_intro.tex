\section{Derivations}

\subsection{Introduction}
The standard model of cosmology relies on several fundamental constants—such as Newton's gravitational constant ($G$) and the permittivity of free space ($\epsilon_0$)—which are empirically measured but not theoretically derived from a common underlying structure. This section rigorously unifies these constants by treating the vacuum not as an empty void, but as a \textbf{Discrete Amorphous Manifold ($\mathcal{M}_A$)} with inherent mechanical and electromagnetic bounds.

We completely abandon heuristic curve-fitting, parameter-tuning, and phenomenological insertions. By treating spacetime as a physical, non-linear discrete graph, we derive the exact constants of Classical Mechanics, Quantum Mechanics, and General Relativity strictly as the emergent macroscopic Effective Field Theory (EFT) limits of discrete Cosserat elastodynamics.
