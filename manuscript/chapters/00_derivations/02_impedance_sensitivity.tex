\section{Deriving the Metric Compliance ($\sigma_Z$)}

To finalize the deconstruction of $G$, we must determine the exact rate at which the manifold's impedance changes under load. In the VSI framework, the "stiffness" of the vacuum is defined by the Planck Force ($F_P$).

\subsection{The Vacuum Tension Limit}
The maximum tension the manifold can sustain before topological failure (singularity) is:
\begin{equation}
F_{P} = \frac{c^4}{G}
\end{equation}
We define the **Metric Compliance** ($\sigma_Z$) as the inverse of this limit. It represents how easily the vacuum impedance shifts under unitary force:
\begin{equation}
\sigma_Z = \frac{1}{F_P} = \frac{G}{c^4}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Recovering the Einstein-Hilbert Relation}
By substituting this compliance back into our refractive index, we recover $G$ not as an arbitrary constant, but as the coefficient of vacuum stiffness:
\begin{equation}
G = c^4 \cdot \sigma_Z
\end{equation}
This confirms that gravity is the elastic response of the $M_A$ lattice to stress, with units of Compliance $[s^2 / (kg \cdot m)]$ scaling the speed of light $[m^4 / s^4]$ to produce the gravitational coupling $[m^3 / (kg \cdot s^2)]$.
