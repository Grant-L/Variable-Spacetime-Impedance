\section{The Thermodynamics of Lattice Genesis}

\subsection{Stable Phantom Dark Energy and the Big Rip Resolution}
During Lattice Genesis, the mechanical pressure required to fund both the internal energy of the newly created vacuum volume ($dU_{vac} = \rho_{vac} dV$) and the exothermic latent heat ejected into the universe ($dQ_{latent} = \rho_{latent} dV$) dictates the exact thermodynamic balance:
\begin{equation}
w_{vac} = \frac{P_{tot}}{\rho_{vac}} = \frac{-(\rho_{vac} + \rho_{latent})}{\rho_{vac}} = -1 - \frac{\rho_{latent}}{\rho_{vac}} < -1
\end{equation}

In standard cosmology, Phantom Energy ($w < -1$) generates a runaway "Big Rip." In AVE, because the density ($\rho_{vac}$) is geometrically locked by the hardware packing fraction ($\kappa_V = 8\pi\alpha$), the lattice physically lacks the structural degrees of freedom to store excess internal work. The excess is entirely ejected as latent heat ($\rho_{latent}$), forever safely averting the Big Rip.

Because the CMB currently follows an adiabatic expansion cooling curve ($T \propto 1+z$), the current radiation density is overwhelmingly dominated by the primordial heat of the Big Bang. However, in the asymptotic limit ($a \to \infty$), adiabatic cooling approaches absolute zero, and the constant latent heat establishes a permanent \textbf{Asymptotic Thermal Attractor Floor} ($u_{rad, \infty} \to \frac{3}{4} \rho_{latent}$).

Because the universe is actively cooling toward absolute zero today, this latent heat floor must be identically bounded by the fundamental background Unruh-Hawking horizon temperature of the expanding causal boundary ($T_U = \hbar H_0 / 2\pi k_B \approx 10^{-30}$ K). Therefore, $\rho_{latent}$ is physically infinitesimal. 

By substituting the known current transient photon density ($\Omega_{rad, today} \approx 5.38 \times 10^{-5}$) as an absolute ceiling, we analytically establish an exact, hard \textbf{upper bound limit} on the Dark Energy equation of state:
\begin{equation}
w_{vac} = -1 - \frac{4 u_{rad, \infty}}{3 \rho_{vac}} > -1 - \frac{4 \Omega_{rad, today}}{3 \Omega_\Lambda}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
w_{vac} > -1 - \frac{4 (5.38 \times 10^{-5})}{3 (0.68)} \approx \mathbf{-1.0001}
\end{equation}
AVE provides the first analytical proof that Dark Energy is bounded Phantom energy ($-1.0001 < w_{vac} < -1$). This cleanly aligns with recent DESI 2024 measurements ($w = -1.04 \pm 0.09$) but strictly forbids the $-1.04$ center value. The framework establishes a rigorous, falsifiable prediction that future high-precision geometric surveys will see $w$ bounded strictly at the infinitesimal limit just beneath $-1.000000$.
