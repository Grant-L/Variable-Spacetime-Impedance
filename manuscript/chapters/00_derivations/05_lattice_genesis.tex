\section{The Thermodynamics of Lattice Genesis}
To rigorously derive the Dark Energy equation of state ($w=-1$) and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) without thermodynamic contradictions, we must model the expanding universe strictly as an \textbf{Open Thermodynamic System undergoing a Phase Transition}.

The First Law of Thermodynamics for an open system expanding via the genesis (crystallization) of new lattice nodes is:
\begin{equation}
dU_{vac} = dQ_{latent} - P dV + \mu dN
\end{equation}
Where $dQ_{latent}$ is the latent heat exchanged, $P dV$ is the mechanical work of expansion, and $\mu dN$ is the chemical work of adding new nodes. 

\subsection{The Dark Energy Pressure ($w = -1$)}
In a spontaneous cosmological phase transition, the vacuum substrate crystallizes from a pre-geometric state. Like photons in a cavity, the macroscopic vacuum nodes possess no conserved chemical potential ($\mu_{vac} = 0$). Because Lattice Genesis creates new volumetric space with a constant baseline structural energy density ($\rho_{vac}$), the internal energy scales strictly with volume ($dU_{vac} = \rho_{vac} dV$). 

With $\mu=0$ and the latent heat ($dQ_{latent}$) expelled into the photon gas rather than retained by the lattice, the energy required to create new vacuum volume must be supplied entirely by the mechanical work of expansion: 
\begin{equation}
dU_{vac} = -P dV \implies \rho_{vac} dV = -P dV \implies P = -\rho_{vac}
\end{equation} 
This yields the exact Dark Energy parameter without relying on flawed closed-system adiabatic assumptions:
\begin{equation}
w = \frac{P}{\rho_{vac}} = -1
\end{equation}

\subsection{The CMB as Latent Heat ($dQ \neq 0$)}
Simultaneously, the physical transition of the unstructured pre-geometric fluid into the discrete $\mathcal{M}_A$ lattice is an exothermic process. The creation of each node releases a discrete quantum of latent heat ($\epsilon_f$) into the ambient photon gas. Therefore, the continuous heat injection rate is $\mathcal{P}_{latent} = (\epsilon_f \dot{N}) / V$.

The continuous volumetric injection of this heat exactly balances the adiabatic cooling of the expanding photon gas ($\dot{u}_{rad} = -4H_0 u_{rad}$). Because the volumetric node creation rate is strictly bounded by Hubble expansion ($\dot{N}/V = 3H_0 \rho_{node}$), we equate the two to find the thermodynamic equilibrium:
\begin{equation}
4H_0 u_{rad} = \epsilon_f (3H_0 \rho_{node}) \implies u_{rad} = \frac{3}{4} \epsilon_f \rho_{node}
\end{equation}
The Hubble parameter ($H_0$) perfectly cancels out! Applying the Stefan-Boltzmann law to the constant energy density $u_{rad}$ proves the universe approaches a rigid, permanent thermal attractor ($T_{CMB} \approx 2.7$ K) dictated exclusively by the latent heat of lattice genesis, entirely resolving the Heat Death paradox.
