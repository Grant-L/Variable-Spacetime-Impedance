\section{AQUAL Fluid Dynamics and the Flat Rotation Curve}
The flat galactic rotation curve is derived directly from the Bingham Plastic Navier-Stokes formulation without arbitrary constant insertions. 

We formally justify the presence of the empirical MOND acceleration boundary ($a_0$) without parameter insertion. The fundamental acceleration floor of the expanding universe corresponds exactly to the Unruh-Hawking acceleration of the cosmic causal horizon. The temperature of a causal horizon is universally governed by $T = \frac{\hbar a}{2\pi c k_B}$. Thus, the factor of $2\pi$ is the fundamental blackbody periodicity required by the geometry of the expanding spherical horizon. The physical geometric Unruh acceleration of the vacuum drift is exactly:
\begin{equation}
a_{genesis} = \frac{c \cdot H_0}{2\pi} \approx 1.1 \times 10^{-10} \text{ m/s}^2
\end{equation}

Because the universe crystallizes exactly $H_0$ new nodes per unit time, the background lattice exerts a continuous macroscopic kinematic drift on all trapped topological defects. This sets a rigid, invariant acceleration floor $a_{genesis}$.

The Bingham Plastic non-Newtonian rheology of the substrate natively modifies the continuous Gauss-Poisson gravitational permeability strictly by the ratio of the localized Keplerian shear ($|\nabla \Phi|$) to this fundamental drift rate: $\mu_{g} \approx |\nabla \Phi|/a_{genesis}$. Integrating the stress equation $\nabla \cdot (\mu_g \nabla \Phi) = 4\pi G \rho_{mass}$ over a galactic mass $M$ natively recovers the exact AQUAL limit:
\begin{equation}
\frac{|\nabla \Phi|^2}{a_{genesis}} = \frac{GM}{r^2} \implies |\nabla \Phi| = \frac{\sqrt{GM a_{genesis}}}{r}
\end{equation}
Equating this to the centripetal acceleration ($v^2/r = |\nabla \Phi|$) mathematically derives the asymptotic flat velocity curve:
\begin{equation}
v_{flat} = (GM a_{genesis})^{1/4}
\end{equation}
This rigorously predicts the Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation solely via the hydrodynamic viscosity of the expanding $\mathcal{M}_A$ fluid and the geometric limits of the cosmic horizon. \textit{Contextual Note:} This matches the macroscopic thermodynamic conclusions of Verlinde's Entropic Gravity, but successfully provides a concrete solid-state mechanical substrate (the Bingham Plastic fluid transition) as the exact physical origin of the entropic force, entirely eliminating the need for mathematical dark matter halos.
