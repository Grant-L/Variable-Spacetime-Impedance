\section{The Principle of Local Impedance Control}
\label{sec:impedance_control}

In the Variable Spacetime Impedance (VSI) framework, vacuum engineering is defined as the active modification of the local $M_A$ lattice[cite: 557, 823]. We do not "curve space" as in the geometric abstractions of General Relativity; instead, we induce physical \textbf{Lattice Strain} ($\sigma$) via external high-frequency toroidal flux to tune the local metric impedance ($Z_{metric}$) and group velocity ($v_g$)[cite: 558, 824].

By saturating or relaxing local nodal densities, the vacuum is transformed into a tunable medium[cite: 559, 825]. The fundamental speed limit $c$ is revealed not as a universal constant, but as the slew rate limit of the \textit{unmodified} ground-state vacuum ($Z_0$)[cite: 89, 826].
