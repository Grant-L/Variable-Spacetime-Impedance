\section{The Engineering Layer: Metric Refraction}
\label{sec:engineering_intro}

\citestart In previous chapters, we established that the vacuum is not a geometric void but a physical, constitutive substrate defined as the Discrete Amorphous Manifold ($M_A$)\cite{1149}\citeend. \citestart Having derived the mechanical origins of mass and gravity (Chapter 2) and the generative expansion of the cosmos (Chapter 6), we now transition from descriptive physics to \textbf{Operational Engineering}\cite{1150}\citeend.

\citestart If the fundamental constants of nature ($c, \epsilon_0, \mu_0$) are bulk engineering properties of the substrate, then localized modification of these properties allows for the manipulation of the metric itself\cite{1151}\citeend. \citestart We move beyond observing the laws of the universe to understanding the hardware that enforces them\cite{1152}\citeend.
