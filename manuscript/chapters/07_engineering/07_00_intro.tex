\section{The Engineering Layer: Metric Refraction}
\label{sec:engineering_intro}

In previous chapters, we established that the vacuum is not a geometric void but a physical, constitutive substrate defined as the Discrete Amorphous Manifold ($M_A$). Having derived the mechanical origins of mass and gravity (Chapter 2) and the generative expansion of the cosmos (Chapter 6), we now transition from descriptive physics to operational engineering.

If the fundamental constants of nature ($c, \epsilon_0, \mu_0$) are bulk engineering properties of the substrate, then localized modification of these properties allows for the manipulation of the metric itself. We move beyond observing the laws of the universe to understanding the hardware that enforces them.
