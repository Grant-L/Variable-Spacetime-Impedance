\section{Metric Shielding and Inertia Nullification}
\label{sec:metric_shielding}

By creating a high-frequency "sheath" of saturated nodes around a vessel, the \textbf{Inertial Back-Reaction} (B-EMF) from the external lattice can be screened[cite: 579, 805]. Because the internal environment is decoupled from the external $M_A$ impedance gradient, the vessel can undergo extreme accelerations without transferring inertial stress to the internal baryonic matter[cite: 580, 806].

The vessel effectively "surfs" on a localized bubble of invariant impedance, rendering the occupants "inertially weightless" even during high-G maneuvers[cite: 581, 807].
