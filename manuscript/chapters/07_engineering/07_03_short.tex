\section{Topological Shorts and Zero-Point Extraction}
\label{sec:topological_shorts}

A "Topological Short" is an engineered defect where the lattice impedance is forced to near-zero ($Z_{metric} \to 0$)[cite: 575]. In this state, the nodes can no longer resist changes in flux, leading to a localized discharge of background vacuum potential[cite: 576]. 

The extraction of vacuum energy is not "free energy," but the mechanical tapping of the manifold's ground-state tension[cite: 577]. The energy yield is proportional to the local node density and the Global Slew Rate $c$[cite: 577]. It represents a high-efficiency phase-transition from stochastic hardware jitter to coherent flux[cite: 577].
