\section{Warp Mechanics: Supersonic Pressure Vessels}

The Alcubierre Warp Drive is classically described as a geometric manipulation of spacetime metrics. In VCFD, it is mechanically identical to a \textbf{Supersonic Pressure Vessel}.

A warp vessel translates faster than light ($v_{eff} > c$) not by exceeding the local acoustic limit, but by generating a localized, extreme pressure gradient in the fluid: High Dielectric Pressure (Compression) in the front, and Low Pressure (Rarefaction) in the rear.

As the vessel accelerates, the synthetic thrust force generated by the differential pressure field across its cross-sectional area ($\oint P \cdot d\mathbf{A}$) must exactly balance the hydrodynamic Viscous Drag of the vacuum medium ($F_{drag} = \frac{1}{2}\rho_{bulk} v_{eff}^2 C_d A_{cross}$). 

\subsection{The Vacuum Sonic Boom (Cherenkov Radiation)}

When the vessel velocity $v_{eff}$ exceeds the bulk vacuum sound speed $c$ ($\text{Mach} > 1$), a conical shockwave (Bow Shock) physically forms at the leading edge. At the shock front, the lattice nodes are mechanically stressed faster than the fundamental hardware relaxation time ($\tau = l_{node}/c$). This forces the generated electromagnetic flux waves into a state of extreme Doppler piling, cascading energy into the highest possible frequency modes up to the Nyquist limit ($\omega_{sat}$). This mechanical shockwave is the precise physical mechanism behind the theoretical \textit{Hawking/Unruh radiation} accumulation at warp thresholds. Upon deceleration, this stored mechanical energy is released as a catastrophic forward-directed gamma-ray flash.
