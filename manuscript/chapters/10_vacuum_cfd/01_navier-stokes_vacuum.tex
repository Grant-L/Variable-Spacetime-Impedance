If the vacuum is a physical fluid (the Amorphous Manifold), it must obey fluid dynamics. We propose that the fundamental equations of the universe are not the Einstein Field Equations, but the **Navier-Stokes Equations** applied to the substrate density ($\permeability$) and stress ($\permittivity$).

\subsection{The Momentum Equation}
The flow of the vacuum substrate ($u$) is governed by:
\begin{equation}
    \rho \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + u \cdot \nabla u \right) = -\nabla P + \eta \nabla^2 u + f_{ext}
\end{equation}
Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\rho \to \permeability$ (Magnetic Inductance / Inertial Density).
    \item $P \to$ The scalar potential (Voltage/Pressure).
    \item $\eta \to$ The Lattice Viscosity (Gravitational coupling).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Recovering Gravity}
In the limit where viscosity is dominant ($\eta \gg 0$) and flow is steady, the Navier-Stokes equation reduces to a form identical to the Poisson equation for gravity:
\begin{equation}
    \nabla^2 \Phi = 4\pi G \rho
\end{equation}
This confirms that **General Relativity is simply the hydrodynamics of the vacuum substrate.** Curvature is pressure gradients; Gravity is the pressure differential pushing objects into the sink.
