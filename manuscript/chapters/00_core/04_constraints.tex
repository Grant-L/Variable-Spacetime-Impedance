\section{Theoretical Constraints on Fundamental Constants}
\label{sec:constraints}

We propose that $G$ and $\hbar$ are not arbitrary scalars but emergent geometric properties of the lattice packing.

\subsection{Derivation of the Planck Action ($\hbar$)}
Standard physics treats $\hbar$ as a fundamental input. In VSI, we derive it as the **Maximum Action Capacity** of a single lattice node.
Consider a single node with capacitance $C_{node} \approx \epsilon_0 l_P$. The energy required to saturate the node (twist the phase by $2\pi$) is the Saturation Energy $E_{sat}$.
The "Action" of this event is the energy integrated over one tick of the lattice clock ($t_{tick} = l_P/c$).
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{S}_{node} = E_{sat} \cdot t_{tick}
\end{equation}
We identify this intrinsic hardware limit as the Planck Constant:
\begin{equation}
    \hbar \equiv \mathcal{S}_{node}
\end{equation}
Thus, Quantum Mechanics is not assumed; it is the inevitable result of a discrete system having a finite "pixel action."

\subsection{The Gravitational Constant ($G$) as Lattice Compliance}
Having defined the energy density of the vacuum without reference to $G$, we now derive gravity as the **Mechanical Compliance** (inverse stiffness) of the lattice.
The \textbf{Yield Force} $F_{yield}$ is the force required to displace the lattice by one pitch ($l_P$) against its saturation energy $E_{sat}$.
\begin{equation}
    F_{yield} = \frac{E_{sat}}{l_P}
\end{equation}
In General Relativity, the "stiffness" of spacetime is defined by the coupling constant $c^4/G$. Equating the Lattice Stiffness to the Einstein Stiffness:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{c^4}{G} = \frac{E_{sat}}{l_P}
\end{equation}
Solving for $G$:
\begin{equation}
    G = \frac{c^4 l_P}{E_{sat}}
\end{equation}
Substituting $E_{sat} = \hbar c / l_P$ (from our derived $\hbar$):
\begin{equation}
    G = \frac{c^3 l_P^2}{\hbar}
\end{equation}
\textbf{Conclusion:} Gravity ($G$) is the measure of how "floppy" the lattice is. A stiff lattice (high $E_{sat}$) yields a small $G$ (weak gravity).
