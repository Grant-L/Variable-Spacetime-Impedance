\chapter{Non-Linear Optics and Falsifiable Predictions}
\label{ch:predictions}

A rigorous mathematical framework must provide explicit, falsifiable predictions that distinguish it from the Standard Model. By treating the physical vacuum as a 4th-order non-linear Cosserat condensate, the AVE framework predicts specific, testable deviations in high-energy optics and electromagnetic coupling limits.
