\chapter{Non-Linear Optics and Falsifiable Predictions}

A rigorous mathematical framework must provide explicit, falsifiable predictions that distin-
guish it from the Standard Model. By treating the physical vacuum as a squared (2nd-order) non-linear
Chiral LC condensate, the AVE framework predicts specific, testable deviations in high-energy
optics and electromagnetic coupling limits.
