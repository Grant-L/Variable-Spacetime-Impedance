\chapter{Active Metric Engineering: Macroscopic Manipulation of the Condensate}
\label{ch:metric_engineering}

If the spatial metric $n(\mathbf{r})$ is a literal physical thermodynamic property of a fluidic substrate (dielectric density and structural viscosity), it can be actively manipulated locally by engineered external electromagnetic fields. We formally define \textbf{Active Metric Engineering} as the technological modulation of the local refractive index and rheological state of the $\mathcal{M}_A$ condensate to dynamically alter its continuous kinematic boundary conditions.
