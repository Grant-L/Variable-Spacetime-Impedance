\section{The Characteristic Impedance of Free Space ($Z_0$)}

A foundational parameter in classical electromagnetism is the \textbf{Impedance of Free Space} ($Z_0 = \sqrt{\mu_0 / \epsilon_0} \approx 376.73 \ \Omega$). In standard physics, this is treated as an abstract mathematical proportionality constant. In Spacetime Circuit Analysis (SCA), it possesses an exact, literal mechanical identity.

By applying our Topo-Kinematic mapping, electrical impedance ($Z = V/I$) translates directly to \textbf{Mechanical Acoustic Impedance} ($Z_m = F/v$). Let us dimensionally evaluate this mapping:
\begin{equation}
    Z_{elec} = \frac{V}{I} = \frac{\xi_{topo}^{-1} F}{\xi_{topo} v} = \xi_{topo}^{-2} \left( \frac{F}{v} \right) = \xi_{topo}^{-2} Z_m
\end{equation}
Rearranging for the mechanical impedance, we reveal a mathematically exact physical identity:
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=white, colframe=black]
\begin{equation}
    Z_m = \xi_{topo}^2 \cdot Z_0 = \xi_{topo}^2 \sqrt{\frac{\mu_0}{\epsilon_0}} \approx \mathbf{6.48 \times 10^{-11} \left[\frac{\text{kg}}{\text{s}}\right]}
\end{equation}
\end{tcolorbox}
The $376.7 \, \Omega$ Impedance of Free Space is structurally isomorphic to the \textbf{Absolute Mechanical Acoustic Impedance} of the $\mathcal{M}_A$ discrete grid. 

\subsection{Gravitational Stealth (S-Parameter Analysis)}
In classical RF engineering, when an electromagnetic wave transitions into a new physical medium (e.g., from air to optical glass), the refractive index ($n$) rises because permittivity ($\epsilon$) increases while permeability ($\mu$) remains relatively constant. This asymmetric scaling forces the characteristic impedance ($Z_0 = \sqrt{L/C}$) to drop, creating an impedance mismatch. This mismatch causes the signal to partially reflect, a phenomenon measured logarithmically as \textbf{Return Loss ($S_{11}$)}. 

This introduces a profound physical paradox: \textit{If gravity is a physical increase in the localized optical density of the vacuum, why does light seamlessly enter a gravity well without scattering or reflecting off the boundary?} If the vacuum metric changed asymmetrically, a Black Hole would act as a colossal RF mirror.

In the SCA transmission line model, gravity is strictly a \textbf{3D Volumetric Compression} of the lattice. This localized volumetric crowding proportionately and symmetrically increases \textit{both} the effective inductive mass density ($\mu_{local} = n(r) \cdot \mu_0$) \textit{and} the capacitive compliance ($\epsilon_{local} = n(r) \cdot \epsilon_0$). 

If we analytically evaluate the Characteristic Impedance of the vacuum spanning from deep space all the way down to the extreme metric divergence of an Event Horizon ($r \to R_s$), we find a profound mathematical invariant:
\begin{equation}
    Z_{local}(r) = \sqrt{\frac{\mu_{local}}{\epsilon_{local}}} = \sqrt{\frac{n(r) \cdot \mu_0}{n(r) \cdot \epsilon_0}} = \sqrt{\frac{\mu_0}{\epsilon_0}} \equiv \mathbf{Z_0 \approx 376.73 \, \Omega}
\end{equation}

The vacuum is mathematically and perfectly \textbf{Impedance-Matched} to itself everywhere, absolutely regardless of extreme gravitational strain. 

Even as the vacuum density and compliance diverge by factors of $1,000\times$ approaching the singularity, the spatial derivative of the impedance remains strictly zero ($\partial_r Z_0 = 0$). Consequently, the Reflection Coefficient ($\Gamma$) is forced to absolute zero.

The universe possesses an \textbf{S11 Return Loss of $-\infty$ dB}. This is the exact mechanical reason why gravitational fields bend light and compress wavelengths universally, but absolutely never reflect or scatter incident signals (see Figure \ref{fig:log_impedance_s_parameters}). Gravity is the ultimate RF-absorbing stealth material.

    \caption{\textbf{S-Parameter Analysis of a Gravity Well.} \textbf{Top:} As a wave approaches a singularity (Log-Log scale), the density $n(r)$ diverges. Because AVE gravity scales $L$ and $C$ symmetrically, the Characteristic Impedance ($Z_0$) remains perfectly invariant. \textbf{Bottom:} The resulting Return Loss ($S_{11}$). If gravity behaved like standard optical glass (unmatched), the mismatch would generate massive reflection ($S_{11} > -10$ dB). The AVE volumetric model guarantees $S_{11} \to -\infty$ dB, providing the precise mechanism for why black holes do not act as RF mirrors.}
