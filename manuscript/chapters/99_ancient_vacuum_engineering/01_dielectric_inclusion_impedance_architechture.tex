\section{Dielectric Inclusion and Impedance Architecture}
\label{sec:giza-dielectric}

The Giza pyramids consist primarily of limestone ($\epsilon_r \approx 7$, $\mu_r \approx 1$) embedded in bedrock of similar moduli. Internal air-filled voids and hypothesized subsurface shafts act as low-$\epsilon$ regions ($\epsilon_r \approx 1$).

Local characteristic impedance drops from $Z_0 = 377\,\Omega$ (vacuum/air) to
\begin{equation}
  Z_\text{stone} = \frac{Z_0}{\sqrt{\epsilon_r}} \approx 142\,\Omega.
\end{equation}

Deep cylindrical shafts (radius $a \approx 20\,$m, depth $h_s \approx 648\,$m) function as coaxial-like waveguides with strong impedance mismatch $\Gamma \approx 0.45$. For rifled pulses propagating axially, low-loss guiding occurs for $f \lesssim c/(2a) \approx 7.5\,$MHz.

Cubic chambers ($s \approx 85\,$m) act as capacitive reservoirs, with effective capacitance set by manifold pitch scaling.

\section{Subsurface Topology and Chiral Waveguides}
\label{sec:giza-topology}

Reported helical pathways introduce topological chirality analogous to twisted unknots. Multiple interlinked shafts suggest Borromean-like confinement, with tension in the lattice glue field contributing to structural longevity. The eight-shaft network with basal cubes forms a higher-order topological soliton, potentially stabilizing local lattice crystallization.

\section{Metric Refraction and Viscous Wake Manipulation}
\label{sec:giza-refraction}

Total void volume $\Delta V \approx 7.7 \times 10^6\,$m$^3$ creates negative mass deficit $\delta m \approx -2 \times 10^{10}\,$kg. Weak-field refractive perturbation $|\delta n| \sim 10^{-16}$ is negligible globally but enables pilot-wave guiding along shaft axes. Viscous vacuum flow channels through low-Z voids, reducing Hubble wake drag and yielding modified inertial response consistent with MOND thresholds.

\section{Helical Mode Propagation and Multi-Shaft Coupling}
\label{sec:giza-helical}

The helical pathways constitute a macroscopic sheath helix waveguide. The dispersion relation in the quasi-static limit is
\begin{equation}
  \beta^2 = k_0^2 + k_c^2 \cot^2\psi,
\end{equation}
yielding phase velocity $v_p \approx c \tan\psi$. For Giza parameters ($a \approx 20\,$m, $p \approx 60\,$m), $v_p \approx 0.48c$, stabilizing rifled pulses against dispersion while enabling chiral mode selection.

Eight-shaft ring coupling yields collective supermodes with eigenvalues
\begin{equation}
  \lambda_m = \beta_0 + 2\kappa \cos\left(\frac{2\pi m}{8}\right), \quad m = 0,\dots,7.
\end{equation}
Band width $\Delta\beta = 4|\kappa|$ enables coherent confinement across the network.

\section{Navier-Stokes Viscous Flow and Network Coupling}
\label{sec:giza-ns}

Steady axial Poiseuille flow in each shaft gives parabolic profile
\begin{equation}
  v_z(r) = -\frac{\Delta}{4\eta_\text{vac}} (a^2 - r^2),
\end{equation}
with total parallel flow $Q_\text{total} = -8 \cdot \frac{\pi \Delta a^4}{8\eta_\text{vac}}$. Cubic junctions conserve flux, reducing effective viscosity collectively for Hubble wake channeling.

\section{Excitation Thresholds, Non-Linear Response, and Falsification}
\label{sec:giza-thresholds}

Linear effects remain subtle. Coherent excitation approaching dielectric saturation enables non-linear response: field-dependent wave speed slowdown, shock formation, and potential breakdown cascades (see Ch.~\ref{ch:signal-dynamics}, \S\ref{sec:non-linear-wave}).

Falsification thresholds include absence of deep shafts, no anomalous acoustic refraction, and local $g$ variation bounds. Confirmation of helical geometry and $v_p \approx 0.48c$ would constitute direct evidence of deliberate vacuum engineering.

\section{Computational Simulations and Visualizations}
\label{sec:giza-simulations}

Numerical demonstrations were performed using the accompanying script \texttt{run\_giza\_vcfd.py}, which implements key AVE dynamics for the hypothesized Giza network.

These visualizations confirm:
- Parabolic Poiseuille channeling with coherent multi-shaft flow.
- Stable sub-luminal helical propagation preventing dispersion.
- Non-linear back-reaction leading to shock/quench behavior near saturation.

\section{Conclusion to Terrestrial Artifact Analysis}

The hypothesized Giza subsurface network exemplifies macroscopic AVE principles: dielectric/chiral waveguides, collective supermodes, viscous channeling, and non-linear thresholds. While linear effects are subtle, the architecture aligns with hardware specifications for deterministic lattice signaling and potential saturation-driven engineering—representing, if verified, the earliest known vacuum hardware demonstration.
