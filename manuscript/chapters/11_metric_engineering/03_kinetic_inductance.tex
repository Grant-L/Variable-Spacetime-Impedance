\section{Kinetic Inductance: The Superconducting Link}
How do we couple to the vacuum? We propose using High-Temperature Superconductors (HTS). In a superconductor, the charge carriers (Cooper Pairs) are coherent macroscopic quantum states. Their inertia is not just mechanical mass; it is \textbf{Kinetic Inductance} ($L_{K}$).

\subsection{The Variable Mass Effect}
We predict that the Kinetic Inductance of a superconductor is directly coupled to the local vacuum impedance $\mu_{0}$.
\begin{equation}
    L_{K}(\sigma) = L_{K}^{0} \cdot \sigma
\end{equation}

\textbf{Engineering Application:} By modulating the vacuum stress $\sigma$ (via high-speed rotation or pulsed electromagnetic toroidal fields), we can dynamically modulate the macroscopic kinetic inductance of a superconducting circuit. This parametric pumping suggests a mechanism for directed momentum exchange with the vacuum substrate.

The most conservative, near-term experimental observable for this effect would be a measurable inductance shift $\Delta L_{K}$ in a controlled high-shear laboratory environment, avoiding the need to invoke speculative reactionless thrust mechanics.
