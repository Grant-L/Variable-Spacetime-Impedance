\section{Kinetic Inductance: The Superconducting Link}
\label{sec:kinetic_inductance}

How do we couple to the vacuum? We propose using \textbf{High-Temperature Superconductors (HTS)}.
In a superconductor, the charge carriers (Cooper Pairs) are coherent macroscopic quantum states. \citestart Their inertia is not just mechanical mass; it is \textbf{Kinetic Inductance} ($L_K$)\cite{einstein1916}\citeend.

\subsection{The Variable Mass Effect}
We predict that the Kinetic Inductance of a superconductor is directly coupled to the local vacuum impedance $\mu_0$.
\begin{equation}
L_K(\sigma) = L_K^0 \cdot \sigma
\end{equation}
\textbf{Engineering Application:} By modulating the vacuum stress $\sigma$ (via high-speed rotation or pulsed electromagnetic toroidal fields), we can dynamically modulate the macroscopic kinetic inductance of a superconducting circuit. This parametric pumping suggests a mechanism for directed momentum exchange with the vacuum substrate. The most conservative, near-term experimental observable for this effect would be a measurable inductance shift $\Delta L_K$ in a controlled high-shear laboratory environment, avoiding the need to invoke speculative reactionless thrust mechanics.
