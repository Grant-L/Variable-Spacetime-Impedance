\section{The Viscosity of Space}
\label{sec:viscosity_term}

The Standard Model assumes the vacuum is a frictionless superfluid. Vacuum Engineering asserts that the Discrete Amorphous Manifold ($M_A$) possesses a finite \textbf{Lattice Viscosity} ($\eta_{vac}$).

Just as water resists the motion of a spoon, the vacuum lattice resists the motion of topological defects (mass). This resistance is not constant; it depends on the scale and coherence of the moving object.

\subsection{Deriving Vacuum Viscosity from Alpha}
We propose that the viscosity coefficient is determined by the geometric coupling constant $\alpha$ (derived in Chapter 3):
\begin{equation}
    \eta_{vac} \approx \alpha \cdot \frac{\hbar}{l_P^3}
\end{equation}
This viscosity implies that gravity is not merely a static field, but a \textbf{Fluid Dynamic} phenomenon. At solar system scales, viscosity is negligible ($Re \gg 1$). At galactic scales, it dominates.
