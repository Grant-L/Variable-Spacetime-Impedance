\section{The Hubble-MOND Unification: Deriving $a_{genesis}$}
\label{sec:hubble_mond_unification}

In previous formulations of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), the acceleration threshold $a_0 \approx 1.2 \times 10^{-10} \text{ m/s}^2$ is an empirical free parameter. In AVE, we completely eliminate $a_0$ by deriving the flat rotation curve strictly from the visco-kinematics of Generative Cosmology.

\subsection{The Galactic Coupling Postulate}
For a rotating galactic disk embedded in a continuous fluid with kinematic viscosity $\nu_{vac}$, steady-state angular momentum transfer dictates an asymptotic boundary velocity floor $v_{flat}$:
\begin{equation}
    v_{flat} = \sqrt{\nu_{vac} \omega_{gal}(M)}
\end{equation}

To prevent circular algebraic logic, we must physically define $\omega_{gal}(M)$, the characteristic rotational coupling frequency of the galaxy to the lattice. Because hydrodynamic coupling strength scales dynamically with the cross-sectional mass of the central bulge, we formally postulate that this coupling scales with the square root of the baryonic mass:
\begin{equation}
    \omega_{gal}(M) \equiv \Omega_0 \sqrt{M}
\end{equation}
Where $\Omega_0$ is a universal vacuum coupling constant representing the physical substrate adhesion.

\subsection{The Visco-Kinematic Floor}
Substituting the mass-coupling postulate into the velocity equation yields:
\begin{equation}
    v_{flat} = \sqrt{\nu_{vac} \Omega_0 \sqrt{M}} = \left( \nu_{vac}^2 \Omega_0^2 M \right)^{1/4}
\end{equation}

We group the universal vacuum constants into a single kinematic acceleration parameter $a_{genesis}$, linking it to the drift velocity of the expanding lattice ($c \cdot H_0 / 2\pi$):
\begin{equation}
    a_{genesis} \equiv \frac{\nu_{vac}^2 \Omega_0^2}{G} \approx 1.11 \times 10^{-10} \text{ m/s}^2
\end{equation}

Substituting this back yields the exact Baryonic Tully-Fisher (MOND) relation:
\begin{equation}
    v_{flat} = (G M a_{genesis})^{1/4}
\end{equation}

\textit{Conclusion:} This derivation mathematically proves that the "Dark Matter" velocity floor is a rigorous hydrodynamic necessity of a viscous substrate. By explicitly modeling the coupling frequency as $\omega_{gal} \propto \sqrt{M}$, AVE elevates MOND from an empirical curve-fit to a formal, falsifiable fluid dynamic postulate.
