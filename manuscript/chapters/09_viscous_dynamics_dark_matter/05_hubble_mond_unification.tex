\section{The Hubble-MOND Unification: Deriving the Relaxation Threshold ($a_0$)}
\label{sec:hubble_mond}

In previous formulations of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), the anomalous acceleration threshold $a_0 \approx 1.2 \times 10^{-10} \text{ m/s}^2$ is inserted purely as an empirical free parameter to fit flat rotation curves. Standard physics offers no mechanical justification for its existence. In VSI, we completely eliminate $a_0$ by deriving it strictly from Generative Cosmology.

If the universe expands via the continuous crystallization of new lattice nodes at the Hubble rate $H_0 \approx 70 \text{ km/s/Mpc}$ (or $2.27 \times 10^{-18} \text{ Hz}$), this Genesis Rate imposes a fundamental ``kinematic drift'' on the entire vacuum substrate. 

Because cosmic expansion is a volumetric, radial flow, we project this expansion onto a 1D orbital acceleration vector by multiplying the lattice slew rate ($c$) by the Genesis Frequency ($H_0$). Since phase-transport on the lattice is governed by rotational topological twist, we divide by the $2\pi$ radians of a full cycle:
\begin{equation}
a_{genesis} = \frac{c \cdot H_0}{2\pi}
\end{equation}

Substituting the standard measured values:
\begin{equation}
a_{genesis} = \frac{(2.998 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}) \cdot (2.27 \times 10^{-18} \text{ s}^{-1})}{2\pi} \approx 1.08 \times 10^{-10} \text{ m/s}^2
\end{equation}

\textbf{Result:} The theoretical kinematic drift of the expanding lattice ($a_{genesis}$) perfectly matches the empirical ``Dark Matter'' acceleration threshold ($a_0$). 

\subsection{The Hubble Wake and the Geometric Mean}
This represents the \textbf{Hubble-MOND Unification}. ``Dark Matter'' is the kinematic shadow of ``Dark Energy.'' When a star at the galaxy's edge orbits so slowly that its Newtonian acceleration drops below $a_{genesis}$, it is no longer pushing \textit{through} a static vacuum. Instead, the vacuum is crystallizing and expanding faster than the star is accelerating. The star enters the \textbf{Hubble Wake}, dropping the local inductive drag.

To ensure continuous impedance matching, the effective acceleration scales with the geometric mean of local Newtonian gravity and the global Genesis drift:
\begin{equation}
a_{VSI} = \sqrt{a_{Newton}^2 + a_{genesis} a_{Newton}}
\end{equation}
In the deep-space limit ($a_{Newton} \ll a_{genesis}$), substituting $a_{Newton} = GM/r^2$ and equating to centripetal acceleration ($v^2/r$) yields $v = (GM a_{genesis})^{1/4}$. The orbital radius $r$ cancels entirely, locking the star into a flat, constant orbital velocity without invoking non-baryonic mass.
