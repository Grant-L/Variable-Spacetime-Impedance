\section{The Flyby Anomaly: Viscous Frame Dragging}

Spacecraft performing gravity-assist maneuvers past Earth often exhibit a small but distinct, unexplained velocity shift ($\Delta v \approx$ mm/s). The Standard Model struggles to explain this via conservative fields. AVE identifies it as a direct measurement of the \textbf{Kinematic Viscosity} of the vacuum near a rotating mass.

As established, a rotating mass physically drags the local vacuum substrate (Fluid Entrainment). A spacecraft entering this region couples directly to the viscous flow of the substrate. The energy transfer is non-zero because the vacuum possesses a non-zero Lattice Viscosity ($\eta_{vac}$):
\begin{equation}
    \Delta E = \int \eta_{vac} \left( \mathbf{v}_{craft} \cdot \nabla\mathbf{v}_{vac} \right) dt
\end{equation}

If the craft executes a prograde flyby, it moves \textit{with} the vacuum flow, reducing drag and appearing as an anomalous energy gain. A retrograde flyby moves \textit{against} the flow, increasing drag. The Flyby Anomaly is a direct, localized laboratory measurement of the exact fluid dynamics that generate Dark Matter at the galactic scale.
