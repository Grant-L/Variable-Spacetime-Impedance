\section{The Flyby Anomaly: Viscous Frame Dragging}
\label{sec:flyby_anomaly}

Spacecraft performing gravity-assist maneuvers past Earth often exhibit a small but unexplained velocity increase ($\Delta v \approx \text{mm/s}$). 
Standard physics struggles to explain this. **Vacuum Engineering** identifies it as a direct measurement of the **Viscosity of the Vacuum** near a rotating mass.

\subsection{The Rotating Gradient}
As established in Section \ref{sec:galactic_rotation}, a rotating mass (Earth) drags the local vacuum substrate. This is not just geometric "Frame Dragging" (Lense-Thirring effect); it is a physical **fluid entrainment**.

\subsection{Energy Transfer Equation}
A spacecraft entering this region couples to the viscous flow of the substrate. The energy transfer is non-zero because the vacuum has a non-zero Lattice Viscosity ($\eta$).
\begin{equation}
    \Delta E = \int \eta (\vec{v}_{craft} \cdot \nabla \vec{v}_{vac}) dt
\end{equation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item **Prograde Flyby:** The craft moves *with* the vacuum flow. Drag is reduced, appearing as an energy gain.
    \item **Retrograde Flyby:** The craft moves *against* the flow. Drag is increased.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Prediction:} The magnitude of the anomaly is directly proportional to the rotation speed of the planet and the **Constitutive Viscosity** ($\eta$) of the local vacuum manifold.
