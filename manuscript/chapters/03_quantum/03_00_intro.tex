\section{Introduction: The End of Probabilistic Abstraction}

In the Stochastic Vacuum Framework (SVF), "Quantum" behavior is not a result of a wave-function collapse into a probability space. \citestart Rather, it is a consequence of the discrete, non-linear nature of the \textbf{Discrete Amorphous Manifold ($M_A$)}[cite: 1003, 1004].

Within this framework, particles are identified as stable \textbf{Topological Defects} (vortices) within the manifold's flux field. \citestart Their discrete properties—spin, charge, and mass—are emergent hardware constraints imposed by the substrate nodes[cite: 1005, 1006].
