\section{Introduction: The End of Probabilistic Abstraction}
\label{sec:quantum_intro}

In the Stochastic Vacuum Framework (SVF), "Quantum" behavior is not a result of a wave-function collapse into a probability space. Rather, it is a consequence of the discrete, non-linear nature of the \textbf{Discrete Amorphous Manifold ($M_A$)}.

Theoretical physics has long treated the vacuum as a continuum. However, any signal processing engineer knows that trying to measure a discrete grid with continuous instruments introduces \textbf{Aliasing Noise}. We perceive this noise as "Heisenberg Uncertainty."

In this framework:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Particles} are stable Topological Defects (vortices).
    \item \textbf{Waves} are the stress-gradients these defects induce in the lattice.
    \item \textbf{Probabilities} are the deterministic result of chaotic feedback (Lattice Memory).
\end{itemize}
