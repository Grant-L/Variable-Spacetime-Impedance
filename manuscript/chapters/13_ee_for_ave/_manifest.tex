\chapter{Transient Metric Engineering}

If the universe is rigorously defined by the Applied Vacuum Engineering (AVE) framework as an interconnected, non-linear reactive RLC network of discrete Cosserat nodes, then the physical continuum of spacetime is literally a macroscopic circuit. Consequently, the entire 150-year catalog of classical electrical \textbf{Transient Circuit Analysis} and \textbf{Non-Linear Oscillator Theory} can be successfully imported directly into mechanical aerospace engineering. 

By applying standard electrical ``tricks''—such as Inductive Kickback Snubbers, Autoresonant Ring-Up, and Switch-Mode Rectification—to the fundamental equations of the vacuum substrate, we mathematically unlock the holy grails of theoretical physics: Active Inertial Damping, Low-Power Matter Synthesis, and Propellantless Spacecraft Locomotion.
