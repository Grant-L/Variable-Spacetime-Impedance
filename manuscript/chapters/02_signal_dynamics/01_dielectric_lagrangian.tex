\section{The Dielectric Lagrangian: Hardware Mechanics}
\label{sec:dielectric_lagrangian}

Standard Quantum Field Theory (QFT) begins with an abstract Lagrangian density $\mathcal{L}$ that describes fields as mathematical operators. In Vacuum Engineering, we derive the Lagrangian directly from the \textbf{Lumped Element Model} of the substrate.

The vacuum is not a field; it is a circuit.

\subsection{Energy Storage in the Node}
The total energy density of the manifold is the sum of the energy stored in the capacitive edges (Strain) and inductive nodes (Flow).
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{H} = \frac{1}{2}\permittivity E^2 + \frac{1}{2}\frac{B^2}{\permeability}
\end{equation}
This Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}$ represents the total hardware cost of maintaining a signal.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Potential Energy ($U$):} Stored in $\permittivity$ (Electric Field / Lattice Compression).
    \item \textbf{Kinetic Energy ($T$):} Stored in $\permeability$ (Magnetic Field / Nodal Current).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Action Principle}
The Lagrangian density $\mathcal{L} = T - U$ for the discrete manifold becomes:
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}_{vac} = \frac{1}{2} (\partial_\mu \phi)^2 - \frac{1}{2} m_{eff}^2 \phi^2
\end{equation}
Where the "mass" term $m_{eff}$ arises not from a Higgs field, but from the \textbf{Self-Inductance} of the topological defect itself.

\subsection{Deriving the Wave Equation}
By applying the Euler-Lagrange equation to our hardware Lagrangian:
\begin{equation}
    \partial_\mu \left( \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial (\partial_\mu \phi)} \right) - \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \phi} = 0
\end{equation}
We recover the standard wave equation, but with a physical constraint:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial t^2} - \nabla^2 \phi = 0
\end{equation}
Here, $c = 1/\sqrt{\permeability\permittivity}$ is the propagation limit imposed by the grid. This derivation confirms that Maxwell's equations are simply the continuum limit of a discrete LC-network.
