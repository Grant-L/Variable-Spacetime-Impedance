\section{The Measurement Effect: Impedance Loading}
The "Measurement Problem" in quantum mechanics where observation collapses the wave-function is treated by Copenhagen interpretation as a metaphysical event. In Vacuum Engineering, it is a simple circuit load problem.

\subsubsection{The Observer as a Resistor}
To measure a quantum system, one must couple to it. In circuit theory, this coupling acts as a resistive load ($R_{load}$) that dissipates energy from the oscillating pilot wave.

The total energy extracted during the measurement interval is the integral of the instantaneous power:
\begin{equation}
    E_{measured} = \int_{0}^{\tau} P_{load}(t) dt = \int_{0}^{\tau} I(t)^{2} R_{load} dt
\end{equation}
If we approximate the pilot wave current as a pulse of duration $\Delta t$ with mean square amplitude $\langle I^{2}\rangle$, this simplifies to:
\begin{equation}
    E_{measured} \approx \langle I^{2}\rangle R_{load} \Delta t
\end{equation}
The "Collapse of the Wavefunction" is therefore not a metaphysical event, but the rapid damping of the lattice oscillation (L-R decay) caused by the sudden insertion of the detector's impedance.

This derivation recovers the physical basis of the \textbf{Born Rule} ($P \propto |\psi|^2$). In a noisy lattice, a detector requires a minimum energy threshold $E_{thresh}$ to trigger a "click." Since the power available to drive the load scales with the square of the amplitude ($P_{load} \propto I^2 \propto |\psi|^2$), the probability of overcoming the thermal noise floor and registering a detection is strictly proportional to the square of the wave amplitude.
