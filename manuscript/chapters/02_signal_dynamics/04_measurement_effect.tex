\section{The Measurement Effect: Impedance Loading}
\label{sec:measurement_effect}

The "Measurement Problem" in quantum mechanics—where observation collapses the wavefunction—is treated by Copenhagen interpretation as a metaphysical event. In Vacuum Engineering, it is a simple circuit load problem.

\subsection{The Observer as a Resistor}
To measure a system, you must couple to it. Coupling extracts energy.
\begin{equation}
    E_{measured} = E_{system} - I^2 R_{load}
\end{equation}
The "Collapse" is merely the rapid damping of the pilot wave due to the sudden impedance drop introduced by the detector. The system does not "decide" to be a particle; the detector drains the wave component, leaving only the inductive core (the particle) behind.
