\section{The Universal Means Test}

The Applied Vacuum Electrodynamics (AVE) framework is deliberately constructed to be a vulnerable theory. Unlike highly parameterized frameworks, AVE makes specific, rigid predictions about the hardware limits of the vacuum that are experimentally testable. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{The Neutrino Parity Test:} Detection of a stable Right-Handed Neutrino propagating in free space falsifies the Cosserat Chiral Bandgap postulate (Chapter 5).
    \item \textbf{The Nyquist Limit:} Detection of any stable signal with a wavelength smaller than $l_{node}$ proves the vacuum is a true geometric continuum, falsifying the discrete manifold model.
    \item \textbf{The Kinematic Viscosity Test:} If local physical mass rotation fails to induce fluidic entrainment in a controlled laboratory interferometer, the macroscopic rheology of the Dark Sector is falsified.
\end{enumerate}
