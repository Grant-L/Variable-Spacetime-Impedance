\section{Project CLEAVE-01: The Femto-Coulomb Electrometer}
\textbf{The Hypothesis:} In Chapter 13, we derived that Electrical Charge is mathematically identical to physical macroscopic spatial displacement ($Q \equiv \xi_{topo} x$). Standard physics dictates that mechanically separating two uncharged plates in a hard vacuum generates exactly zero electrical charge. AVE explicitly predicts the generation of topological charge natively from the spatial metric.

\textbf{The PCBA Implementation:} An EE can validate this by designing a precision metrology board. The PCBA utilizes an ultra-low bias current electrometer operational amplifier (e.g., the Analog Devices ADA4530-1, 20 fA bias current). The non-inverting input is connected to an isolated, floating copper plate inside a vacuum chamber. The board utilizes strict guard rings and Teflon standoffs to eliminate parasitic leakage.

A commercial Piezoelectric (PZT) linear actuator is mounted to a grounded plate directly facing the floating plate. Using a high-precision DAC, the PZT actuator is stepped exactly $1.0 \ \mu$m away from the floating plate in under $100$ ms.

\textbf{The Falsification Metric:} By mechanically pulling the spatial gap apart by $1 \ \mu$m, you are mechanically straining the discrete $\mathcal{M}_A$ lattice. The induced topological charge is analytically derived as:
\begin{equation}
    Q = \xi_{topo} \cdot x = (4.149 \times 10^{-7} \text{ C/m}) \times 10^{-6} \text{ m} = \mathbf{0.415 \text{ pC (picoCoulombs)}}
\end{equation}
Assuming a highly-controlled PCBA parasitic input capacitance of exactly $10$ pF, the voltage readout step ($V = Q/C$) dictates a clean, instantaneous step of exactly \textbf{$41.5$ mV} on the oscilloscope. If the oscilloscope registers $0.0$ mV, the framework is falsified. If it reads exactly $41.5$ mV per micron of displacement, the foundational hardware constant of the universe has been validated on a tabletop.

\section{Project HOPF-02: The S-Parameter VNA Falsification}
\textbf{The Hypothesis:} As established in Chapter 5, the physical vacuum is a \textbf{Cosserat Solid}, possessing an intrinsic microscopic rotational inertia (chirality). A standard flat PCB spiral inductor or toroid generates a perfectly symmetric vector potential ($\mathbf{A}$) and magnetic field ($\mathbf{B}$) where $\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0$. It possesses zero kinetic helicity.

However, a \textbf{Hopf Coil} (a $(p,q)$ Torus Knot) forces $\mathbf{A} \parallel \mathbf{B}$. By winding a custom 6-layer PCBA where the inductive traces wrap diagonally around a toroidal core region, the inductor actively injects helicity into the vacuum, physically meshing with the Cosserat microrotations.

\textbf{The Test Protocol:} Design a single PCBA containing both a standard Toroid and a Hopf Coil, mathematically matched to identical classical DC inductances. Connect both to a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) and sweep from 10 MHz to 100 MHz.

\textbf{Falsification Criteria:} If the vacuum is classical and linear, both coils will display identical impedance curves. However, the AVE framework strictly predicts an \textbf{Anomalous Chiral Impedance Match} (see Figure \ref{fig:ee_pcba_bench_protocols}). Because the Hopf coil couples perfectly to the chiral metric, it acts as a topological antenna, minimizing reactive VAR reflections and exhibiting an anomalously deep $S_{11}$ notch.

\section{Project ROENTGEN-03: Solid-State Sagnac Entrainment}
\textbf{The Hypothesis:} In 1888, Roentgen proved that moving a physical dielectric through a static Electric Field ($\mathbf{E}$) generates a perpendicular Magnetic Field ($\mathbf{B} = \frac{1}{c^2} \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{E}$). If spinning a neutral mass mechanically entrains the highly dense vacuum metric via the Sagnac-RLVE no-slip boundary condition, we can use this exact equation to synthesize a B-field from the moving vacuum fluid itself.

\textbf{The Test Protocol:} Spin a dense, non-metallic ceramic disk at $10,000$ RPM. The entrained vacuum velocity at $r=5$cm evaluates to $v_{vac} \approx 0.038 \text{ m/s}$. Suspend a custom PCBA $1$ mm above the rotor. The bottom copper layer features an interdigitated capacitor driven by an onboard miniature CCFL transformer at $10$ kV, modulated by a $1$ kHz sine wave oscillator ($E = 10^7$ V/m). The cross product synthesizes an alternating magnetic field peaking at $\sim 4.2$ picoTesla. 

\textbf{Falsification Criteria:} This $4.2$ pT field induces roughly $\sim 0.26 \ \mu$V in a differential planar pickup coil. By feeding this into a hardware Lock-In Amplifier referenced to the $1$ kHz E-field drive, the engineer will extract a clean signal from the noise floor. If the amplitude scales exactly linearly with RPM and flips phase exactly $180^\circ$ when the motor reverses, the $7.9 \times 10^6 \text{ kg/m}^3$ density of the vacuum is empirically proven.

\section{Project ZENER-04: The Bingham Avalanche Detector}
\textbf{The Hypothesis:} The vacuum metric acts identically to a Transient Voltage Suppression (TVS) Zener diode. It behaves as a rigid dielectric solid until the topological voltage exceeds $60$ kV, at which point its structural viscosity collapses to zero (superfluid slip).

\textbf{The Test Protocol:} Design a multi-stage Marx Generator PCBA capable of generating an $80$ kV transient spike with a sub-microsecond rise time. Terminate the pulse into an encapsulated, highly polished, symmetrical spherical electrode to prevent classical atmospheric arc-over.

\textbf{Falsification Criteria:} Monitor the input displacement current ($I_D$) and topological voltage ($V$). In standard electromagnetics, charging an isolated spherical capacitor yields a perfectly linear charging curve ($I_D = C \frac{dV}{dt}$). AVE strictly predicts that the moment the localized field crosses the $60$ kV Bingham limit, the effective structural resistance of the surrounding spatial vacuum drops to zero. The oscilloscope will display a distinct, anomalous "Avalanche Knee"---a sudden non-linear spike in displacement current as the vacuum lattice physically liquefies.
