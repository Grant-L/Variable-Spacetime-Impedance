\section{The Neutrino Parity Kill-Switch}
\label{sec:neutrino_parity}

\citestart The most direct falsification of the Chiral Bias Equation (Chapter 1) and the Chiral Exclusion Principle (Chapter 5) lies in the detection of right-handed neutrinos\cite{einstein1916}\citeend.

The SVF predicts that the vacuum impedance for a right-handed topological twist ($Z_{RH}$) is effectively infinite due to the substrate's intrinsic orientation $\Omega_{vac}$. \citestart This prevents propagation beyond a single lattice pitch ($l_0$)\cite{einstein1916}\citeend.

\citestart \textbf{Kill Condition:} If a stable, propagating Right-Handed Neutrino is detected in any laboratory or astrophysical event, the Chiral Bias postulate and the hardware origin of Parity Violation is fundamentally falsified\cite{einstein1916}\citeend.
