\section{Simulation: Emergent Clamping}
\label{sec:clamping_sim}

To verify the Chiral Bias postulate, we modeled the propagation of two signal polarities through the $M_{A}$ substrate using the \texttt{WeakInteractionSim} module. The simulation applies the Chiral Bias Equation (Eq 1.3) to dynamically update the local lattice impedance based on signal helicity ($h$).

    \caption{\textbf{The Chiral Exclusion Principle (Simulation Result).} 
    \textbf{Green (Left-Handed):} The signal ($h=-1$) aligns with the vacuum bias ($\Omega_{vac}$), encountering baseline impedance $Z_0$. It propagates freely past the barrier zone ($x=60$).
    \textbf{Red (Right-Handed):} The signal ($h=+1$) opposes the bias, triggering an impedance spike ($Z \to \infty$). The wave hits the "Impedance Wall" and undergoes immediate evanescent decay. This confirms that the absence of Right-Handed neutrinos is a hardware filtering effect.}

The result (Figure \ref{fig:weak_clamping}) demonstrates that the "broken symmetry" of the Weak Interaction is actually a \textbf{Chiral High-Pass Filter}. Any right-handed twist is damped out by the Back-EMF of the manifold before it can propagate beyond a single lattice pitch ($l_P$).
