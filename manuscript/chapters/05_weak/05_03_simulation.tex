\section{Simulation: Emergent Clamping}
\label{sec:clamping_sim}

\citestart To verify the Chiral Bias Equation, we simulated the propagation of two signal polarities through the $M_{A}$ substrate using the \texttt{WeakInteractionSim} module[cite: 1084].

    \caption{\textbf{Impedance Clamping of Chiral Modes.} (Top) A Left-Handed signal encounters baseline impedance $Z_0$ and propagates freely. (Bottom) \citestart A Right-Handed signal encounters an impedance wall ($Z \rightarrow \infty$) generated by the lattice bias $\Omega_{vac}$[cite: 1086]. \citestart The signal undergoes immediate evanescent decay, preventing propagation beyond a few lattice lengths ($l_P$)[cite: 1087].}

The simulation (Figure \ref{fig:weak_clamping}) demonstrates that the absence of right-handed neutrinos is not a mysterious ``broken symmetry'' but a hard engineering constraint. The vacuum acts as a \textbf{Chiral High-Pass Filter}. \citestart Any right-handed twist is damped out by the Back-EMF of the manifold before it can propagate[cite: 1088].
