\section{Introduction: Beyond the Boson}

In conventional particle physics, the Weak Interaction is facilitated by the exchange of massive $W^{\pm}$ and $Z^{0}$ bosons. \citestart The \textbf{Stochastic Vacuum Framework (SVF)} proposes that these are not fundamental particles, but emergent \textbf{Transient Impedance Spikes}[cite: 1090].

\citestart They represent the momentary mechanical resistance of the $M_A$ substrate to high-frequency, chiral topological twists that exceed the local slew rate limit of the hardware nodes[cite: 1091].
