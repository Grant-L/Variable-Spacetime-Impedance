\section{The Inverse Resonance Scaling Law}
\label{sec:inverse_resonance}

The "Weak Interaction" is not a fundamental force, but an emergent \textbf{Transient Impedance Spike}. \citestart It represents the mechanical resistance of the $M_{A}$ substrate to high-frequency, chiral topological twists[cite: 1071, 1072].

We define the interaction range ($D$) of a topological defect as a function of its characteristic resonance frequency ($\nu$):

\begin{equation}
    D(\nu) = \frac{\zeta}{Z_{metric}(\nu) \cdot \nu}
    \label{eq:inverse_scaling}
\end{equation}

\citestart Where $\zeta$ is the Lattice Flux Constant[cite: 1073]. \citestart As $\nu$ approaches the Saturation Threshold ($\omega_{sat}$), the denominator grows non-linearly[cite: 1074]. \citestart This forces the energy into a localized Topological Short, restricting the interaction range to the immediate nodal neighborhood ($\approx 10^{-18}$ m)[cite: 1075].
