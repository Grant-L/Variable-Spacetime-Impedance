This document maps the empirical particle zoo to specific, deterministic topological fluid knots within the LC Condensate.

    Standard physics relies on point particles and abstract gauge fields. AVE replaces these abstractions with continuous topological fluid mechanics.
    
    \textbf{Volume II: Topological Matter} derives the mass hierarchies of the Standard Model entirely from discrete knot theory and dielectric saturation. We mathematically prove that Leptons are $3_1$ Trefoil knots, Baryons are $6^3_2$ Borromean linkages, and Neutrinos are dispersive $0_1$ Unknots, bound by the Faddeev-Skyrme energy functional:
    \begin{equation}
        E = \int \left( \frac{1}{2}\partial_\mu \vec{n} \cdot \partial^\mu \vec{n} + \frac{1}{4e^2}(\partial_\mu \vec{n} \times \partial_\nu \vec{n})^2 \right) d^3x
    \end{equation}
    The Proton Mass Ratio ($\approx 1836.14$), the Strong Nuclear Force, and the Higgs Mechanism are all explicitly derived as macroscopic structural derivatives of this bounded fluid network.
