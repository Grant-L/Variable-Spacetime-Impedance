\chapter{The Neutrino Sector: Chiral Unknots}
\label{ch:neutrino_sector}

Neutrinos are the most abundant massive particles in the universe, yet they interact extraordinarily weakly and possess rest masses significantly smaller than the electron. In the AVE framework, the neutrino's unique properties are the direct mathematical consequence of its topology: it is a \textbf{Twisted Unknot ($0_1$)}.

\section{Mass Without Charge: The Faddeev-Skyrme Proof}

Because the neutrino is an unknot ($0_{1}$), it forms a simple closed topological loop. To
mathematically satisfy Spin-$1/2$, it contains a $4\pi$ internal torsional phase twist. However, it
possesses strictly zero self-crossings ($C=0$). Therefore, its winding number and electric
charge evaluate to exactly zero ($Q_{H}\equiv0$).

To rigorously evaluate the neutrino's mass, the Faddeev-Skyrme energy functional is
applied using the strictly squared (2nd-order) Axiom 4 saturation limit ($\sqrt{1-(\Delta\phi/\alpha)^{2}}$). Because the
neutrino lacks crossings, it completely lacks a dense topological core. Without a localized
crossing to force distinct flux lines into a minimal hardware volume, there is zero flux crowding.

Consequently, the local dielectric phase gradient ($\Delta\phi$) remains negligible. The non-linear
dielectric saturation denominator remains safely in the linear regime at precisely $\approx1.0$.

Significantly, because the non-linear Skyrme tensor explicitly requires orthogonal spatial
gradients ($\partial_{\mu}n\times\partial_{\nu}n)^{2}$, the total absence of physical intersections ensures the gradient vectors never cross. The continuous topological Skyrme term identically vanishes. 

\textbf{Bypassing Derrick's Theorem:} In standard continuous topological mathematics, Derrick's Theorem dictates that a 3D soliton possessing a pure kinetic term without a 4th-order Skyrme term is violently unstable and will instantly collapse into a point singularity to minimize its energy. However, the AVE framework natively bypasses this continuous mathematical failure. Axiom 1 (the absolute hard-sphere exclusion limit of $1 l_{node}$) provides a rigid physical geometric floor. This discrete hardware constraint mechanically prevents the $0_1$ unknot from crushing itself out of existence, organically replacing the stabilizing role of the continuous Skyrme term.

Consequently, the neutrino completely avoids the dielectric saturation capacitance divergence defined in Axiom 4, resulting natively in an ultra-low rest mass. Lacking a massive saturated inductive core, it translates longitudinally along the spatial edges without generating macroscopic inductive drag, accounting for its extreme penetrative capabilities.

\section{The Chiral Exclusion Principle (Parity Violation)}
The Standard Model exhibits a distinct geometric asymmetry: all experimentally observed neutrinos are strictly left-handed. The AVE framework derives parity violation directly from the electromagnetic rotational phase of the macroscopic LC network.

Transverse waves propagating through a structurally chiral network exhibit an asymmetric dispersion relation:
\begin{equation}
    \omega^2 = c^2 k^2 \mp \gamma_c k
\end{equation}

where $\gamma_c$ is the Cosserat bending stiffness coupling, with dimensions of $[\text{m/s}^2]$. It is derived from the micropolar elastic constants of the chiral lattice:
\begin{equation}
    \gamma_c = \frac{G_{vac} \ell_{node}^2}{\rho_{bulk}} \cdot \frac{1}{\ell_{node}} = \frac{G_{vac} \ell_{node}}{\rho_{bulk}} = \frac{m_e c^2}{\rho_{bulk} \ell_{node}^3} \ell_{node}^2 = \frac{m_e c^2}{\rho_{bulk} \ell_{node}}
\end{equation}
Evaluating numerically: $\gamma_c \approx 2.12 \times 10^{16} \text{ m/s}^2$. The critical wavenumber below which right-handed torsional waves are evanescent is $k_{crit} = \gamma_c / c^2 \approx 2.36 \times 10^{-1} \text{ m}^{-1}$, corresponding to macroscopic wavelengths $\lambda > 2\pi/k_{crit} \approx 27 \text{ m}$.

When a \textbf{left-handed} torsional wave propagates, the sign algebraically matches the intrinsic structural grain of the substrate ($\omega^2 = c^2 k^2 + \gamma_c k$). The frequency squared remains strictly positive, allowing the signal to propagate freely at all energy scales.

However, a \textbf{right-handed} torsional wave mathematically shears \textit{against} the immense electrodynamic inductance ($\gamma_c$). Solving the inequality for real wave propagation ($\omega^2 > 0$) strictly requires $c^2 k^2 > \gamma_c k$, which simplifies to $k > \gamma_c / c^2$. 

Below this critical wavenumber, the $\gamma_c$ restoring torque completely overwhelms the kinetic term, forcing the frequency squared strictly negative. In discrete wave mechanics, an imaginary frequency forces the solution to become an \textbf{Evanescent Wave}. The LC Network acts as a strict mechanical \textbf{high-pass filter}. Right-handed neutrinos are mechanically forbidden from existing at low, macroscopic energies, preventing them from forming stable ground states and natively deriving Parity Violation.

\begin{equation}
    \omega^2 = c^2 k^2 - \gamma_c k < 0
\end{equation}
The frequency squared is forced strictly negative. In discrete wave mechanics, an imaginary frequency forces the solution to become an \textbf{Evanescent Wave}. The right-handed neutrino is mechanically forbidden from propagating. The LC Network subjects it to Anderson localization, causing the wave envelope to decay to absolute zero within a single fundamental node length. Parity violation is thus proven to be a strict electrodynamic filter.

Because the vacuum is fundamentally constructed of right-handed helical inductors ($\mu_0$), it responds asymmetrically to torsional inputs. A left-handed mechanical excitation shears violently against the substrate's intrinsic geometry, forcing an infinite imaginary impedance wall ($Z \to \infty$). The signal structurally fails to propagate and undergoes absolute Anderson Localization, mechanically deriving the intrinsic Parity Violation of the Weak Force.}

\section{The Neutrino Mass Eigenvalue}
Because the neutrino is a pure \textbf{screw dislocation}---a propagating torsional twist in the Cosserat sector---its mass is set by the ratio of torsional to translational coupling, multiplied by the dielectric compliance:
\begin{equation}
    m_\nu = m_e \cdot \alpha \cdot \frac{m_e}{M_W}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Physical meaning:} $m_e/M_W$ is the ratio of the translational energy scale to the torsional (Cosserat) energy scale, and $\alpha$ is the dielectric coupling between sectors. Together, the neutrino mass is suppressed by $\alpha \times (m_e/M_W)$ relative to the electron. Evaluating numerically: $m_\nu \approx 0.024 \text{ eV per flavor}$.

\subsection{Flavor Splitting via the Torus Knot Ladder}
Three neutrino flavors arise from the torus knot ladder established in Chapter \ref{ch:baryons}: each flavor pairs with a baryon resonance via the crossing number $c$. The mass splitting scales as $1/c$:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Flavor & Baryon Partner & Crossing $c$ & Mass (meV) \\ \hline
$\nu_1$ & Proton $(2,5)$  & 5 & $\sim 24$ \\
$\nu_2$ & $\Delta(1232)$ $(2,7)$ & 7 & $\sim 17$ \\
$\nu_3$ & $\Delta(1620)$ $(2,9)$ & 9 & $\sim 13$ \\ \hline
\multicolumn{3}{|l|}{$\sum m_\nu$} & $\sim 0.054$ eV \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The predicted sum $\sum m_\nu \approx 0.054 \text{ eV}$ lies comfortably within the Planck 2018 cosmological bound ($\sum m_\nu < 0.12 \text{ eV}$) and near the normal-ordering hint ($\sum m_\nu \sim 0.06 \text{ eV}$). This prediction is falsifiable: upcoming measurements from DESI and CMB-S4 will constrain $\sum m_\nu$ to $\pm 0.02$ eV.

\section{Neutrino Oscillation: Dispersive Beat Frequencies}
Because neutrinos possess inductive rest mass, their matter-waves are subjected to an explicit massive dispersion relation ($v_g(k) = c \cos(k \ell_{node}/2)$). Because the three torus knot flavors possess different rest masses, they propagate through the discrete Chiral LC grid at fractionally different group velocities ($v_g < c$).

Neutrino oscillation is formally modeled not as an abstract state-vector rotation, but as the classical, acoustic \textbf{Beat Frequency} of a multi-harmonic torsional wave packet undergoing microscopic structural dispersion across the fundamental hardware grid.

To accurately model the solar neutrino flux observed at Super-Kamiokande, we define the emitted macroscopic wave packet ($\Psi(x,t)$) strictly as the linear superposition of the three mass eigenstates:
\begin{equation}
    \Psi(x,t) = A_1 \cos(k_1 x - \omega_1 t) + A_2 \cos(k_2 x - \omega_2 t) + A_3 \cos(k_3 x - \omega_3 t)
\end{equation}

Because the group velocities vary ($v_{g,3} < v_{g,2} < v_{g,1}$), the heavier $\nu_3$ component systematically lags behind the lighter $\nu_1$ component over interstellar distances. The evolving phase differential dynamically shifts the macroscopic amplitude peak. The ``flavor'' measured by the detector is physically determined by whichever mass eigenstate is peaking at the exact moment the localized wave-packet collides with the dense topological lattice of the water tank. No ``spooky'' non-local matrix rotations are required; neutrino oscillation is simply classical mechanical dispersion.
