This document translates the foundational mechanics of Variable Spacetime Impedance into the realm of biological chemistry.

\begin{abstract}
    For decades, the spontaneous self-assembly of proteins has been treated as a computational paradox (Levinthal's Paradox) solved only by heuristic AI guesswork or impossibly vast force-field simulations. 

    \textbf{Volume V: Topological Biology} proves that the fundamental building blocks of life are explicit macroscopic manifestations of the Algebraic Vacuum Equation (AVE). By mapping amino acid sequences into strictly deterministic Topological Impedance values, this text formally derives organic molecules as structural AC transmission lines. 

    The framework presented herein successfully bypasses heuristic data-fitting, demonstrating that biological geometries such as Alpha-Helices and Beta-Sheets naturally emerge as the absolute minimum topological strain state of the underlying $1/r^3$ vacuum lattice.
