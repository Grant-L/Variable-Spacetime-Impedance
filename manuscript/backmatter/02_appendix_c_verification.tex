\section{Appendix C: System Verification Trace}
\label{app:verification_trace}

The following log was generated by the \texttt{verify\_universe.py} automated validation engine. It certifies that the fundamental limits and parameters derived in this text are calculated using exact Cosserat continuum mechanics, finite-difference algebras, and $O(3)$ non-linear topological relaxation. All hardcoded integer numerology, fractional scaling approximations, and arbitrary SI dimensional additions from prior iterations (Patch 1.0) have been strictly purged.
