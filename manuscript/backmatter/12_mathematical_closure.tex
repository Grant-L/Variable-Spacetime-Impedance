\section{The Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) Proof}
To definitively establish that the Applied Vacuum Engineering (AVE) framework possesses strict mathematical closure without phenomenological curve-fitting, the framework maps the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of its derivations.

The entirety of the framework's predictive power is derived by bridging \textbf{Three Initial Hardware Parameters} with \textbf{Four Topological Axioms}.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Parameter 1 (The Spatial Cutoff):} The effective macroscopic spatial scale of the lattice ($\ell_{node}$) is anchored identically by the mass-gap of the fundamental fermion.
    \item \textbf{Parameter 2 (The Dielectric Bound):} The absolute structural self-impedance of the macroscopic lattice is rigidly governed by the fine-structure constant ($\alpha$).
    \item \textbf{Parameter 3 (The Machian Boundary):} Macroscopic Gravity ($G$) acts as the structural impedance parameter defining the causal limits of the manifold.
    \item \textbf{Axiom 1 (Topo-Kinematic Isomorphism):} Charge is identically equal to spatial dislocation ($[Q] \equiv [L]$).
    \item \textbf{Axiom 2 (Chiral LC Elasticity):} The macroscopic vacuum acts as an effective trace-free Chiral LC Network supporting microrotations.
    \item \textbf{Axiom 3 (Discrete Action Principle):} The macroscopic system minimizes Hamiltonian action across the localized phase transport field ($\mathbf{A}$).
    \item \textbf{Axiom 4 (Dielectric Saturation):} The effective lattice compliance is bounded by a strictly squared mathematical limit ($n=2$). Taylor expanding this squared limit precisely bounds the volumetric energy required by the standard QED Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian.
\end{enumerate}

From these initial geometric anchors and four structural rules, all fundamental constants dynamically emerge as the strict mechanical limits of the EFT:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Geometry \& Symmetries (Parameters 1 \& 2):} Dividing the localized topological yield by the continuous macroscopic Schwinger yield strictly dictates the emergence of the macroscopic fine-structure geometric constant ($1/\alpha = 8\pi/p_c$). The strict $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry of the Borromean proton natively generates $SU(3)$ color symmetry, evaluating the Witten Effect to exactly predict $\pm 1/3e$ and $\pm 2/3e$ fractional charges.
    \item \textbf{Electromagnetism (Axioms 1 \& 3):} Axiom 1 yields the topological conversion constant ($\xi_{topo}$), proving magnetism is rigorously equivalent to kinematic convective vorticity ($\mathbf{H} = \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{D}$).
    \item \textbf{The Electroweak Layer (Axiom 2):} To satisfy the exact QED volumetric packing fraction, the spatial graph mathematically requires structural over-bracing. Under non-affine macroscopic hydrostatic compression, localized buckling rigorously engages the intrinsic Chiral LC microrotational stiffness. This perfectly locks the macroscopic bulk modulus to $K_{vac} \equiv 2G_{vac}$. This trace-reversed geometric boundary natively forces the macroscopic vacuum Poisson's ratio to $\nu_{vac} = 2/7$, which identically evaluates the exact empirical Weak Mixing Angle acoustic mass ratio ($m_W / m_Z = \sqrt{7}/3 \approx 0.8819$).
    \item \textbf{Gravity and Cosmology (Axiom 2):} Projecting a 1D QED string tension into the 3D bulk metric via the strictly trace-reversed tensor natively yields the $1/7$ isotropic projection factor for massive defects. Integrating the 1D causal chain across the 3D holographic solid angle, bounded exactly by the cross-sectional porosity ($\alpha^2$) of the discrete graph, analytically binds macroscopic gravity ($G$) and the Asymptotic de Sitter Expansion Limit ($H_\infty$) into a single, unified mathematical identity.
    \item \textbf{The Dark Sector (Axiom 4):} The strict EFT hardware packing fraction ($p_c approx 0.1834$) limits excess thermal energy storage during lattice genesis, proving Dark Energy is a mathematically stable phantom energy state ($w \approx -1.0001$). The generative expansion of the lattice sets a fundamental continuous Unruh-Hawking drift. The exact topological derivation of the substrate mass density ($\rho_{bulk}$) and mutual inductance ($\nu_{vac}$) dictates a saturating Dielectric Saturation-plastic transition, mathematically recovering the exact empirical MOND acceleration boundary ($a_{genesis} = c H_\infty / 2\pi$), dynamically yielding flat galactic rotation curves without invoking non-baryonic particulate dark matter.
\end{itemize}

Because physical parameters flow exclusively outward from initial geometric bounding limits to the macroscopic continuous observables---without looping an output back into an unconstrained input---the AVE framework represents a mathematically closed, predictive, and explicitly falsifiable Topological Effective Field Theory.
