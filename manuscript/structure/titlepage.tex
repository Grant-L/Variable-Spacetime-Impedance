        Theoretical physics has reached a juncture where the mathematical complexity of our models has outpaced our mechanical understanding. This text proposes a return to hardware: treating the vacuum not as a geometric abstraction, but as a \textbf{Discrete Amorphous Manifold ($M_A$)} governed by finite inductive and capacitive limits. From this substrate, we derive Inertia, Gravity, and Mass as emergent engineering properties of a tunable transmission medium.
