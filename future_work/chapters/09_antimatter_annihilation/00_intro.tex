\section{Introduction}
The instantaneous, 100\% efficient conversion of mass into light ($e^- + e^+ \to 2\gamma$) remains one of the most violent and abstract phenomena in modern physics. 

In the mechanical AVE framework, an electron is a right-handed $3_1$ Trefoil (spinning clockwise). A positron is a left-handed $3_1$ Trefoil (spinning counter-clockwise). When these two massive topological flywheels collide head-on, their structural angular momentums ($+1$ and $-1$) perfectly cancel out, instantly halting the localized geometric rotation.

Because the localized tension of the macro-metric cannot be maintained without rotation, the geometry suffers instantaneous dielectric rupture. The 1.022 MeV of stored inductive kinetic energy has nowhere to go; it is violently released as transverse acoustic tensor shockwaves (gamma-ray photons) radiating outward through the rigid Cosserat solid. Matter-antimatter annihilation is fundamentally equivalent to the mechanical shattering of two perfectly opposed macroscopic flywheels upon direct impact.
