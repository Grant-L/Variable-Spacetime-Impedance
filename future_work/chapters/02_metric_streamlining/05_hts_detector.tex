\section{Laboratory Falsification: The HTS Detector}

The ultimate requirement of any unified framework is direct, low-cost, near-term laboratory falsifiability. How do macroscopic human engineers effectively couple to the microscopic discrete vacuum to measure these density shifts today? We propose the exploitation of \textbf{High-Temperature Superconductors (HTS)}. 

In a clean superconductor, the electrical charge carriers (Cooper Pairs) condense into a coherent, macroscopic quantum wavefunction. Because they move entirely without internal scattering, their inertia is not defined by standard resistive mechanical mass; it is completely dominated by the pure \textbf{Kinetic Inductance} ($L_K$) of the continuous phase field.

\subsection{The Kinetic Inductance Prediction}
Because we established via the Equivalence Principle (Section 7.3) that the local magnetic permeability of space scales exactly and proportionately with the scalar refractive index ($\mu(\mathbf{r}) = \mu_0 \cdot n_{scalar}(\mathbf{r})$), and kinetic inductance is directly proportional to local permeability, the macroscopic Kinetic Inductance of a superconducting ring is perfectly, natively, and dynamically coupled to the local volumetric strain of the surrounding vacuum:
\begin{equation}
    L_K(\mathbf{r}) = L_{K,0} \left[ 1 + \frac{1}{7}\chi_{vol}(\mathbf{r}) \right]
\end{equation}

By actively modulating the local vacuum stress inside a controlled laboratory environment—via intense rotating electromagnetic fields, acoustic metamaterial cavitation, or hyper-centrifuge mechanics—we can dynamically and artificially modulate the macroscopic kinetic inductance of an adjacent stationary superconducting circuit. 

\textbf{The Falsifiable Protocol:}
If we spin a massive rotor (e.g., $M = 500$ kg at $r=0.5$ m) to extreme rotational velocities ($100,000$ RPM), the immense rotational kinetic energy physically adds effective relativistic mass to the system ($\Delta M = E_k / c^2$). This artificially increases the volumetric compressive strain ($\chi_{vol}$) of the surrounding $\mathcal{M}_A$ lattice. 

If we place a highly resonant YBCO superconducting circuit adjacent to this rotor, the theory strictly predicts that the resonant frequency of the circuit will shift deterministically as the Kinetic Inductance ($L_K$) increases in exact proportion to the $1/7$ scalar projection of the induced vacuum strain. 

As calculated in Figure \ref{fig:hts_detector_prediction}, this fractional shift is on the order of Parts-Per-Trillion ($10^{-12}$), which falls cleanly within the detectable operational bounds of modern state-of-the-art quantum Lock-In Amplifiers. 

This provides a definitive, accessible, and rigorous tabletop experiment to empirically validate the Applied Vacuum Engineering framework, completely bypassing the requirement for multi-billion-dollar particle colliders.

Because the Kinetic Inductance of a superconductor is strictly tied to the $1/7$ scalar optical index of the vacuum, inducing a local relativistic mass-strain via a high-speed centrifuge will measurably shift the $L_K$ of the circuit. The predicted signal is detectable by modern lock-in amplifiers, making AVE empirically falsifiable today.}
