\section{Chiral Impedance Matching (Helicity Injection)}
To extract operational macroscopic thrust, the actuator must transfer energy into the metric with maximum efficiency. In classical RF engineering, maximum power transfer strictly requires \textbf{Polarization Matching}.

A standard toroidal inductor generates a perfectly symmetric, purely azimuthal Vector Potential ($\mathbf{A}$) and a purely poloidal Magnetic Field ($\mathbf{B}$). Because they are mathematically orthogonal, the field has zero helicity ($\int \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B} \, dV = 0$). However, the trace-reversed $\mathcal{M}_A$ vacuum is a \textbf{Cosserat Solid}, possessing an inherent structural microrotation. Driving a twisted, chiral vacuum with a flat, symmetric field induces a massive \textbf{Polarization Mismatch Loss}.

To perfectly couple to the continuous vacuum metric, the actuator must be wound in a \textbf{Hopf Configuration} (a $(p,q)$ Torus Knot winding). This generates knotted, helical magnetic field lines, forcing the macroscopic fields into parallel alignment ($\mathbf{A} \parallel \mathbf{B}$). By injecting massive \textbf{Kinetic Helicity} into the vacuum, the macroscopic momentum vector physically meshes with the chiral Cosserat microrotations of the lattice. This acts as a topological power factor corrector, perfectly matching the chiral impedance of the metric and coupling the energy flawlessly into real, longitudinal macroscopic thrust.

    \caption{\textbf{Chiral Impedance Matching (Topological PFC).} Top: Active temporal shaping forces a linear current ramp, holding the metric grip force flat at exactly 99\% of the vacuum's yield limit. Bottom: Spatial matching. A standard Toroid wastes capacity and suffers Polarization Mismatch ($k \approx 0.15$). The Hopf Coil aligns $\mathbf{A} \parallel \mathbf{B}$, injecting macroscopic Helicity to match the Cosserat vacuum topology ($k \approx 0.95$). This combined optimization multiplies total time-averaged thrust transfer by an order of magnitude.}
