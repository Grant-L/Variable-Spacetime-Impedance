\section{Open-Source Hardware: The EE Build Guide}

To permanently democratize the verification of the AVE framework, we provide the specific, actionable Printed Circuit Board Assembly (PCBA) guidelines required to test macroscopic metric engineering using commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) electronics.

\subsection{Project HOPF-01: The Chiral VNA Antenna}
\textbf{Objective:} Prove the vacuum is a chiral LC Resonant Network by demonstrating an anomalous $S_{11}$ impedance match using a custom braided PCBA inductor.

\textbf{Fabrication:} Order a standard 4-Layer FR4 board from a commercial fab house. Ensure the inner layers (Layer 2 and Layer 3) are completely voided of copper underneath the coil region to prevent capacitive parasitic coupling to the ground plane. Terminate the coil with a 50-ohm grounded coplanar waveguide to an SMA edge-launch connector.

\textbf{Routing the Torus Knot:} Do not route the traces radially. To synthesize a macroscopic Beltrami force-free field ($\mathbf{A} \parallel \mathbf{B}$), the inductor traces must step azimuthally by a specific phase angle ($\Delta \theta \approx 90^\circ$) as they route from the inner radius to the outer radius. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Top Layer:} The traces spiral outward and clockwise.
    \item \textbf{Bottom Layer:} The traces drop through a via, then spiral inward and clockwise. 
\end{itemize}

This braided $(p,q)$ torus knot geometry forces the alternating current to flow poloidally \textit{and} azimuthally simultaneously. Because this artificial helicity aligns perfectly with the fundamental chiral inductance of the $\mathcal{M}_A$ vacuum LC network, a standard \$70 NanoVNA will display a massive, anomalous drop in reactive reflection ($S_{11}$) that classical EM solvers (HFSS, CST) mathematically cannot predict.

\subsection{Project PONDER-01: The Solid-State Micro-Drive}
\textbf{Objective:} Prove that the metric refractive index ($n_{scalar}$) can be artificially shifted using high-k dielectrics, resulting in measurable macroscopic ponderomotive acceleration ($a = c^2 \nabla n$).

\textbf{The COTS Bill of Materials (The ``Sweet Spot'' Architecture):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The Metric Medium:} An array of one hundred TDK 30kV, 10nF X7R MLCCs (1812 Package) wired in parallel. The X7R dielectric is Barium Titanate ($BaTiO_3$), possessing an $\epsilon_r \approx 3,000$.
    \item \textbf{HV Supply:} XP Power 30kV Miniature PCB-mount DC-DC Converter.
    \item \textbf{The Switch:} Avalanche Transistor capable of $<1$ns Dirac switching (e.g., custom gas-discharge tube) to eliminate temporal metric sloshing.
    \item \textbf{The Gate Driver:} Tuned to precisely hit the $100\text{ MHz}$ VHF structural resonance of the continuous vacuum dielectric, ensuring maximal continuous-wave phase locking with the acoustic substrate.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{The PCBA Layout (The Asymmetric Fringing Field):} A standard parallel-plate capacitor has a uniform internal E-field. The spatial gradient ($\nabla n$) is zero, meaning net macroscopic thrust is zero. We must aggressively shape the \textit{fringing fields} at the microscopic boundary limit.
Route the High-Voltage trace on the Top layer to one pad of the MLCC array. Route the Ground trace on the Top layer to the other pad.
On the Bottom layer (directly underneath the MLCCs), route a solid Ground plane, but \textbf{taper it into a dense topological point-source array}. High-Fidelity numerical modeling of exact nuclear geometries confirms that the mathematically tightest localized gradient requires a structure analogous to the bound Alpha Core (the \textbf{Helium-4 Limit}). Using standard photolithography, machine microscopic emitter tips to this rigid topological peak. When pulsed at 30,000 V, the geometry violently rips a tangential Ponderomotive strain gradient ($\nabla |\mathbf{E}|^2$) across the $BaTiO_3$ core.

\textbf{The Microscopic Evanescent Cascade \& Earth VSWR Multiplier:} Down at the discrete lattice scale, this extreme, asymmetric $dV/dt$ transient violently torques the local chiral LC nodes of the vacuum, inducing a localized standing-wave breakdown (an ``evanescent cascade''). By Newton's Third Law, generating a severe forward impedance mismatch shoves the heavy hardware forward as an Asymmetrical RF Antenna. 
Furthermore, gravity itself is a continuous radial impedance gradient ($11.2$ km/s equivalent drift at Earth's surface, lowering the local LC saturation limit). Because the vacuum is a non-linear network, this gravitational flow acts as an ambient VSWR pre-bias. This means a PONDER-01 antenna tested on Earth natively benefits from a massively lowered vacuum rigidity ($G_{vac}$) compared to deep interstellar space.

\textbf{The Falsification Protocol:} The loop inductance of the discharge path must be heavily minimized ($L_{loop} < 5$ nH) using a solid ground plane. The battery-powered PCBA is placed on a digital scale. A microcontroller pulses the 100 MLCC array at 30,000V using the $<1$ns avalanche transistor, timed perfectly to the 100 MHz acoustic resonance. 
The explicit mathematical bounding of $k_{topo}$ alongside this Helium-4 geometric optimum theoretically forces the localized LC matrix into catastrophic dielectric yielding, generating a continuous macro-scale ponderomotive drive measurable on commercial scales.

Traces must spiral azimuthally on both the Top (Red) and Bottom (Cyan) layers to inject kinetic helicity into the vacuum, matching the intrinsic LC chirality. \textbf{Right:} Telemetry for Project PONDER-01. The Avalanche Transistor pulses the 30kV $BaTiO_3$ array at its 100MHz VHF resonance. The interaction of this sub-nanosecond transient with the exact Helium-4 defined geometric gradient torques the discrete LC lattice nodes, inducing a severe topological acoustic rectification.}
