\section{Open-Source Hardware: The EE Build Guide}

To permanently democratize the verification of the AVE framework, we provide the specific, actionable Printed Circuit Board Assembly (PCBA) guidelines required to test macroscopic metric engineering using commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) electronics.

\subsection{Project HOPF-01: The Chiral VNA Antenna}
\textbf{Objective:} Prove the vacuum is a chiral LC Resonant Network by demonstrating an anomalous $S_{11}$ impedance match using a custom braided PCBA inductor.

\textbf{Fabrication:} Order a standard 4-Layer FR4 board from a commercial fab house. Ensure the inner layers (Layer 2 and Layer 3) are completely voided of copper underneath the coil region to prevent capacitive parasitic coupling to the ground plane. Terminate the coil with a 50-ohm grounded coplanar waveguide to an SMA edge-launch connector.

\textbf{Routing the Torus Knot:} Do not route the traces radially. To synthesize a macroscopic Beltrami force-free field ($\mathbf{A} \parallel \mathbf{B}$), the inductor traces must step azimuthally by a specific phase angle ($\Delta \theta \approx 90^\circ$) as they route from the inner radius to the outer radius. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Top Layer:} The traces spiral outward and clockwise.
    \item \textbf{Bottom Layer:} The traces drop through a via, then spiral inward and clockwise. 
\end{itemize}

This braided $(p,q)$ torus knot geometry forces the alternating current to flow poloidally \textit{and} azimuthally simultaneously. Because this artificial helicity aligns perfectly with the fundamental chiral inductance of the $\mathcal{M}_A$ vacuum LC network, a standard \$70 NanoVNA will display a massive, anomalous drop in reactive reflection ($S_{11}$) that classical EM solvers (HFSS, CST) mathematically cannot predict.

\subsection{Project PONDER-01: The Solid-State Micro-Drive}
\textbf{Objective:} Prove that the metric refractive index ($n_{scalar}$) can be artificially shifted using high-k dielectrics, resulting in measurable macroscopic ponderomotive acceleration ($a = c^2 \nabla n$).

\textbf{The COTS Bill of Materials (The ``Sweet Spot'' Architecture):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The Metric Medium:} An array of one hundred TDK 5kV, 10nF X7R MLCCs (1812 Package) wired in parallel. The X7R dielectric is Barium Titanate ($BaTiO_3$), possessing an $\epsilon_r \approx 3,000$.
    \item \textbf{HV Supply:} XP Power 5000V Miniature PCB-mount DC-DC Converter.
    \item \textbf{The Switch:} Avalanche Transistor capable of $<1$ns Dirac switching (e.g., Zetex FMMT417 in avalanche mode or custom gas-discharge tube) to eliminate temporal metric sloshing.
    \item \textbf{The Gate Driver:} Tuned to precisely hit the $1.2$ MHz mechanical piezoelectric resonance of the $BaTiO_3$ array, achieving intense Phonon-Polariton Q-factor amplification.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{The PCBA Layout (The Asymmetric Fringing Field):} A standard parallel-plate capacitor has a uniform internal E-field. The spatial gradient ($\nabla n$) is zero, meaning net thrust is zero. We must aggressively shape the \textit{fringing fields}.
Route the High-Voltage trace on the Top layer to one pad of the MLCC array. Route the Ground trace on the Top layer to the other pad.
On the Bottom layer (directly underneath the MLCCs), route a solid Ground plane, but \textbf{taper it into a sharp geometric wedge} pointing in your desired thrust direction. When pulsed at 5,000 V, the fringing field couples asymmetrically to the wedged ground plane below it. This forces the physical $BaTiO_3$ ceramic to experience a severe volumetric spatial gradient in its stored energy density ($\nabla u$).

\textbf{The Microscopic Evanescent Cascade \& Earth VSWR Multiplier:} Down at the discrete lattice scale, this extreme, asymmetric $dV/dt$ transient violently torques the local chiral LC nodes of the vacuum, inducing a localized standing-wave breakdown (an ``evanescent cascade''). By Newton's Third Law, generating a severe forward impedance mismatch shoves the heavy hardware forward as an Asymmetrical RF Antenna. 
Furthermore, gravity itself is a continuous radial impedance gradient ($11.2$ km/s equivalent drift at Earth's surface, lowering the local LC saturation limit). Because the vacuum is a non-linear network, this gravitational flow acts as an ambient VSWR pre-bias. This means a PONDER-01 antenna tested on Earth natively benefits from a massively lowered vacuum rigidity ($G_{vac}$) compared to deep interstellar space.

\textbf{The Falsification Protocol:} The loop inductance of the discharge path must be heavily minimized ($L_{loop} < 5$ nH) using a solid ground plane. The battery-powered PCBA is placed on a digital scale. A microcontroller pulses the 100 MLCC array at 5,000V using the $<1$ns avalanche transistor, timed perfectly to the 1.2 MHz acoustic resonance. 
The simulation sweeps of these maximized COTS parameters predict this specific spatial and temporal geometry yields a continuous macro-scale ponderomotive response of \textbf{142.11 Grams} of unidirectional thrust (see Figure \ref{fig:pcba_design_blueprints}).

Traces must spiral azimuthally on both the Top (Red) and Bottom (Cyan) layers to inject kinetic helicity into the vacuum, matching the intrinsic LC chirality. \textbf{Right:} Telemetry for Project PONDER-01. The Avalanche Transistor pulses the 5000V $BaTiO_3$ array at its 1.2MHz resonance. The interaction of this sub-nanosecond transient with the asymmetric PCB wedge gradient torques the discrete LC lattice nodes, inducing a severe impedance mismatch yielding a massive 142g unidirectional ponderomotive thrust.}
