\section{Open-Source Hardware: The EE Build Guide}

To permanently democratize the verification of the AVE framework, we provide the specific, actionable Printed Circuit Board Assembly (PCBA) guidelines required to test macroscopic metric engineering using commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) electronics.

\subsection{Project HOPF-01: The Chiral VNA Antenna}
\textbf{Objective:} Prove the vacuum is a chiral Cosserat solid by demonstrating an anomalous $S_{11}$ impedance match using a custom braided PCBA inductor.

\textbf{Fabrication:} Order a standard 4-Layer FR4 board from a commercial fab house. Ensure the inner layers (Layer 2 and Layer 3) are completely voided of copper underneath the coil region to prevent capacitive parasitic coupling to the ground plane. Terminate the coil with a 50-ohm grounded coplanar waveguide to an SMA edge-launch connector.

\textbf{Routing the Torus Knot:} Do not route the traces radially. To synthesize a macroscopic Beltrami force-free field ($\mathbf{A} \parallel \mathbf{B}$), the inductor traces must step azimuthally by a specific phase angle ($\Delta \theta \approx 90^\circ$) as they route from the inner radius to the outer radius. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Top Layer:} The traces spiral outward and clockwise.
    \item \textbf{Bottom Layer:} The traces drop through a via, then spiral inward and clockwise. 
\end{itemize}

This braided $(p,q)$ torus knot geometry forces the alternating current to flow poloidally \textit{and} azimuthally simultaneously. Because this artificial helicity aligns perfectly with the microrotational chiral structure of the $\mathcal{M}_A$ vacuum, a standard \$70 NanoVNA will display a massive, anomalous drop in reactive reflection ($S_{11}$) that classical EM solvers (HFSS, CST) mathematically cannot predict.

\subsection{Project PONDER-01: The Solid-State Micro-Drive}
\textbf{Objective:} Prove that the metric refractive index ($n_{scalar}$) can be artificially shifted using high-k dielectrics, resulting in measurable macroscopic ponderomotive acceleration ($a = c^2 \nabla n$).

\textbf{The COTS Bill of Materials:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The Metric Medium:} An array of twenty TDK 3kV, 10nF X7R MLCCs (1812 Package). The X7R dielectric is Barium Titanate ($BaTiO_3$), possessing an $\epsilon_r \approx 3,000$.
    \item \textbf{HV Supply:} XP Power FS10 (Miniature PCB-mount 1000V DC-DC Converter).
    \item \textbf{The Switch:} Wolfspeed \textbf{C3M0030090K} (900V, 30m$\Omega$ SiC MOSFET). Chosen for extreme $dV/dt$ capability.
    \item \textbf{The Gate Driver:} Texas Instruments \textbf{UCC27531} (High-speed, 2.5A peak gate driver).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{The PCBA Layout (The Asymmetric Fringing Field):} A standard parallel-plate capacitor has a uniform internal E-field. The spatial gradient ($\nabla n$) is zero, meaning net thrust is zero. We must aggressively shape the \textit{fringing fields}.
Route the High-Voltage trace on the Top layer to one pad of the MLCC array. Route the Ground trace on the Top layer to the other pad.
On the Bottom layer (directly underneath the MLCCs), route a solid Ground plane, but \textbf{taper it into a sharp geometric wedge} pointing in your desired thrust direction. When pulsed at 1,000 V, the fringing field couples asymmetrically to the wedged ground plane below it. This forces the physical $BaTiO_3$ ceramic to experience a severe volumetric spatial gradient in its stored energy density ($\nabla u$).

\textbf{The Falsification Protocol:} The loop inductance of the discharge path must be heavily minimized ($L_{loop} < 5$ nH) using a solid ground plane. The battery-powered PCBA is placed on an Ohaus Analytical Micro-balance (0.1 mg resolution). A microcontroller pulses the MLCC array at 1000V. The extreme $dV/dt$ transient collapsing across the asymmetric gradient rectifies the vacuum. Multiplied by $c^2$, this generates roughly $\sim 47 \ \mu$N of continuous, measurable time-averaged DC thrust, appearing as a blatant $\sim 4.8$ milligram weight reduction on the scale (see Figure \ref{fig:pcba_design_blueprints}).

Traces must spiral azimuthally on both the Top (Red) and Bottom (Cyan) layers to inject kinetic helicity into the vacuum, matching the Cosserat solid. \textbf{Right:} Telemetry for Project PONDER-01. The SiC MOSFET pulses the 1000V $BaTiO_3$ array. The interaction of this transient with the asymmetric PCB wedge gradient yields a macroscopic, unidirectional ponderomotive thrust, verified as a 4.8 mg weight shift.}
