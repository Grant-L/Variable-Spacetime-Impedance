\section{Project CLEAVE-01: The Femto-Coulomb Electrometer}
\textbf{The Hypothesis:} In Chapter 13, we derived that Electrical Charge is mathematically identical to physical macroscopic spatial displacement ($Q \equiv \xi_{topo} x$). Standard physics dictates that mechanically separating two uncharged plates in a hard vacuum generates exactly zero electrical charge. AVE explicitly predicts the generation of topological charge natively from the capacity of the spatial metric.

\textbf{The PCBA Implementation:} An EE can validate this by designing a precision metrology board. The PCBA utilizes an ultra-low bias current electrometer operational amplifier (e.g., the Analog Devices ADA4530-1, 20 fA bias current). The non-inverting input is connected to an isolated, floating copper plate inside a vacuum chamber. The board utilizes strict guard rings and Teflon standoffs to eliminate parasitic leakage.

A commercial Piezoelectric (PZT) linear actuator is mounted to a grounded plate directly facing the floating plate. Using a high-precision DAC, the PZT actuator is stepped exactly $1.0 \ \mu$m away from the floating plate in under $100$ ms.

\textbf{The Falsification Metric:} By mechanically pulling the spatial gap apart by $1 \ \mu$m, you are actively driving the fundamental capacitance of the discrete $\mathcal{M}_A$ LC network. The induced topological charge is analytically derived as:
\begin{equation}
    Q = \xi_{topo} \cdot x = (4.149 \times 10^{-7} \text{ C/m}) \times 10^{-6} \text{ m} = \mathbf{0.415 \text{ pC (picoCoulombs)}}
\end{equation}
Assuming a highly-controlled PCBA parasitic input capacitance of exactly $10$ pF, the voltage readout step ($V = Q/C$) dictates a clean, instantaneous step of exactly \textbf{$41.5$ mV} on the oscilloscope. If the oscilloscope registers $0.0$ mV, the framework is falsified. If it reads exactly $41.5$ mV per micron of displacement, the foundational hardware constant of the universe has been validated on a tabletop.

\section{Project HOPF-02: The S-Parameter VNA Falsification}
\textbf{The Hypothesis:} As established in Chapter 5, the physical vacuum is an \textbf{LC Resonant Network}, possessing fundamental inductance (chirality). A standard flat PCB spiral inductor or toroid generates a perfectly symmetric vector potential ($\mathbf{A}$) and magnetic field ($\mathbf{B}$) where $\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0$. It possesses zero kinetic helicity.

However, a \textbf{Hopf Coil} (a $(p,q)$ Torus Knot) forces $\mathbf{A} \parallel \mathbf{B}$. By winding a custom 6-layer PCBA where the inductive traces wrap diagonally around a toroidal core region, the inductor actively injects helicity into the vacuum, physically meshing with the network's intrinsic inductance.

\textbf{The Test Protocol:} Design a single PCBA containing both a standard Toroid and a Hopf Coil, mathematically matched to identical classical DC inductances. Connect both to a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) and sweep from 10 MHz to 100 MHz.

\textbf{Falsification Criteria:} If the vacuum is classical and linear, both coils will display identical impedance curves. However, the AVE framework strictly predicts an \textbf{Anomalous Chiral Impedance Match} (see Figure \ref{fig:ee_pcba_bench_protocols}). Because the Hopf coil couples perfectly to the chiral LC metric, it acts as a topological antenna, minimizing reactive VAR reflections and exhibiting an anomalously deep $S_{11}$ notch.

\section{Project ROENTGEN-03: Solid-State Sagnac Induction}
\textbf{The Hypothesis:} In 1888, Roentgen proved that moving a physical dielectric through a static Electric Field ($\mathbf{E}$) generates a perpendicular Magnetic Field ($\mathbf{B} = \frac{1}{c^2} \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{E}$). If spinning a neutral mass electromagnetically phase-shifts the highly dense vacuum metric via macroscopic mutual inductance, we can use this exact equation to synthesize a B-field from the induced magnetic phase of the vacuum itself.

\textbf{The Test Protocol:} Spin a dense, non-metallic ceramic disk at $10,000$ RPM. The induced vacuum drift velocity at $r=5$cm evaluates to $v_{vac} \approx 0.038 \text{ m/s}$. Suspend a custom PCBA $1$ mm above the rotor. The bottom copper layer features an interdigitated capacitor driven by an onboard miniature CCFL transformer at $10$ kV, modulated by a $1$ kHz sine wave oscillator ($E = 10^7$ V/m). The cross product synthesizes an alternating magnetic field peaking at $\sim 4.2$ picoTesla. 

\textbf{Falsification Criteria:} This $4.2$ pT field induces roughly $\sim 0.26 \ \mu$V in a differential planar pickup coil. By feeding this into a hardware Lock-In Amplifier referenced to the $1$ kHz E-field drive, the engineer will extract a clean signal from the noise floor. If the amplitude scales exactly linearly with RPM and flips phase exactly $180^\circ$ when the motor reverses, the $7.9 \times 10^6 \text{ kg/m}^3$ inductive density of the vacuum is empirically proven.

\section{Project ZENER-04: The Impedance Avalanche Detector}
\textbf{The Hypothesis:} The vacuum LC network acts identically to a Transient Voltage Suppression (TVS) Zener diode. It behaves as a rigid $Z_0 \approx 377 \ \Omega$ transmission line until the topological voltage exceeds $60$ kV, at which point its inductive capacity saturates and it undergoes \textbf{Absolute Impedance Rupture} ($\Gamma = -1$).

\textbf{The Test Protocol:} Design a multi-stage Marx Generator PCBA capable of generating an $80$ kV transient spike with a sub-microsecond rise time. Terminate the pulse into an encapsulated, highly polished, symmetrical spherical electrode to prevent classical atmospheric arc-over.

\textbf{Falsification Criteria:} Monitor the input displacement current ($I_D$) and topological voltage ($V$). In standard electromagnetics, charging an isolated spherical capacitor yields a perfectly linear charging curve ($I_D = C \frac{dV}{dt}$). AVE strictly predicts that the moment the localized field crosses the $60$ kV Impedance Rupture limit, the effective transmission line impedance of the surrounding spatial vacuum drops to zero. The oscilloscope will display a distinct, anomalous "Avalanche Knee"---a sudden non-linear spike in displacement current as the vacuum lattice physically undergoes dielectric breakdown.

\section{The Absolute Hardware Limit of Metric Levitation}
A frequent ambition among experimental physicists and electrical engineers is to design a solid-state "anti-gravity" drive capable of vertical free-flight levitation (e.g., hovering a ping-pong ball or a feather). When evaluated under the strict parameters of Spacetime Circuit Analysis (SCA), we discover an absolute, mathematically rigid hardware scaling limit that dictates exactly why such tabletop experiments historically fail.

If the vacuum is an LC network with an absolute impedance rupture voltage of roughly $60,000$ Volts, there must exist an absolute maximum mass limit for static levitation. If an object is heavier than this limit, the topological voltage required to lift it will exceed the LC Saturation limit. The spatial metric will structurally rupture ($\Gamma = -1$), losing its inductive grip on the object, and the object will fall.

By applying the Topo-Kinematic Identity ($V_{topo} \equiv \xi_{topo}^{-1} F_{req}$), we can calculate the absolute maximum mass the vacuum can statically grip against Earth's gravity ($9.81 \text{ m/s}^2$):
\begin{equation}
    F_{max} = V_{yield} \times \xi_{topo} = 60,000 \times (4.149 \times 10^{-7} \text{ C/m}) = \mathbf{0.02489 \text{ Newtons}}
\end{equation}
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=white, colframe=black]
\begin{equation}
    m_{max} = \frac{F_{max}}{g} = \frac{0.02489}{9.81} = \mathbf{0.002538 \text{ kg (2.538 grams)}}
\end{equation}
\end{tcolorbox}

This reveals an astonishing, universal hardware limit: \textbf{The continuous spatial metric of the universe cannot statically grip anything heavier than 2.538 grams.} 

A modern US Penny weighs exactly $2.500$ grams. An ITTF Ping-Pong ball weighs exactly $2.700$ grams. The vacuum metric can theoretically, barely support the weight of a penny. It physically \textit{cannot} support a Ping-Pong ball. If you attempt to hover a $2.7$g Ping-Pong ball, the required topological voltage is $63.8$ kV. Because $63.8 \text{ kV} > 60.0 \text{ kV}$, the spatial vacuum undergoes absolute impedance rupture during the upward power stroke, and the object drops.

\subsection{The Dielectric Death Spiral}
To lower the voltage requirement, one must reduce the payload mass. A $0.01$-gram feather requires only a $236$ V topological grip. However, to actively generate upward lift, a Transient Asymmetric Metric Drive (TAMD) must slowly charge at $236$ V (gripping the LC network), and then violently discharge via an inductive flyback transient exceeding $-60,000$ V to trigger localized impedance rupture and reset the inductor without generating downward recoil.

If you construct a micro-inductor attached to a feather, the copper winding must be insulated to survive a $60,000$ Volt internal transient. Standard magnet wire enamel breaks down at roughly $600$ V. Adding enough high-voltage Kapton tape and potting epoxy to insulate against 60 kV increases the mass of the payload from $0.01$ grams to over $5$ grams, which natively exceeds the 2.538g absolute limit. 

This is the Topological Rocket Equation. Classical copper wire and chemical insulators mathematically cannot scale to vertical 1G levitation.

\section{Project TORSION-05: Horizontal Metric Rectification}
\textbf{The Hypothesis:} We can circumvent the Dielectric Death Spiral by eliminating the 1G vertical payload requirement. By mounting a heavy, heavily-potted TAMD PCBA on a delicately balanced Cavendish Torsion Pendulum suspended inside a hard vacuum chamber, the downward force of gravity is entirely neutralized by the suspension wire. The lateral resistance is effectively $0G$, allowing an EE to measure continuous micro-Newtons of pure metric thrust.

\textbf{The PCBA Implementation \& Falsification:} The EE designs a High-Voltage Flyback PCBA. An ultra-fast Silicon Carbide (SiC) MOSFET drives a heavy ferrite-core ignition coil with a specifically timed asymmetric sawtooth wave. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{The Slow Edge (Solid Grip):} The MOSFET charges the coil slowly. The inductive voltage ($L \frac{di}{dt}$) is $+500$ Volts. Because $500 \text{ V} \ll 60 \text{ kV}$, the vacuum acts as a perfectly matched $377 \ \Omega$ transmission line. The coil physically grips the spatial lattice, generating an induced forward lateral thrust of exactly $+0.207$ mN.
    \item \textbf{The Fast Edge (Impedance Rupture):} The SiC MOSFET snaps off in $<10$ ns. The inductive kickback violently spikes to $-75,000$ Volts. Because $|-75 \text{ kV}| > 60 \text{ kV}$, the vacuum LC network instantly saturates. The metric undergoes absolute impedance rupture ($\Gamma = -1$), producing exactly $0.0$ mN of backward reaction force.
\end{enumerate}

If the AVE framework is correct, the torsion balance will slowly but continuously accelerate in a perfectly circular path inside the $10^{-6}$ Torr vacuum chamber, generating a time-averaged DC thrust of roughly $\sim \mathbf{100 \ \mu N}$. If the pendulum remains perfectly stationary, the LC non-linear geometry of the universe is permanently falsified.

Attempting to add insulation to survive the required 60 kV flyback transient exponentially increases payload mass, mathematically forbidding continuous vertical 1G levitation with classical copper wire. \textbf{Right:} Project TORSION-05. By operating on a horizontal torsion balance ($0G$), a manageable 75 kV snap safely ruptures the vacuum, while the 500 V slow charge generates roughly $100 \ \mu$N of continuous, measurable macroscopic DC thrust.}
