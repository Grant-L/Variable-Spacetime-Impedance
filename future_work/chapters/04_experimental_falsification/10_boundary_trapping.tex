\section{Protocol 10: Orbital Detritus and Boundary Trapping}
\label{sec:boundary_trapping}

A standing anomaly in standard orbital mechanics is the distinct, rigid localization of macroscopic detritus into specific zones, such as the Asteroid Belt and the Oort Cloud. While standard models often rely on complex, ad-hoc planetary shepherding resonance theories (like Jupiter's gravitational influence) to explain this containment, they struggle to explain the sheer uniformity of the deep-space Oort Cloud boundary.

The non-linear AVE topological framework predicts these zones natively as a requirement of macroscopic inductive drag. The Sun's massive gravitational core draws a tremendous topological ``slipstream'' through the background LC Network. 

As this local dielectric strain ($h_{\perp} \propto \frac{1}{r}$) falls off with distance, it eventually intersects and collides with the static background impedance floor of deep galactic space. This intersection creates a sharp topological sheer boundary—a domain where the localized vacuum impedance gradient diverges rapidly.

\subsection{Macroscopic Filtering and Falsification}
Any low-mass detritus traversing this impedance boundary will experience a sudden spike in Inductive Drag (topological friction), shedding orbital kinetic energy and ceasing transverse migration.

Therefore, the Asteroid Belt and Oort Cloud are not random accumulations; they are the physical manifestations of the Inner and Outer termination shocks of the Solar metric slipstream. 
Falsification of this topological theory relies on logging the transit velocities of deep-space probes (e.g., the Pioneer Anomaly). A probe crossing the $\sim 15,000$ AU Oort Cloud transition zone should mathematically register a sudden, otherwise inexplicable spike in transit drag as it pierces the dielectric sheer boundary, confirming the absolute macroscopic mutual inductance limit of the Solar metric.
