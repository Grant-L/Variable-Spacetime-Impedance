\section{Introduction}
If an electron stores energy indefinitely because its Beltrami, knot-like geometry cleanly prevents magnetic flux from radiating into the ambient vacuum, this exact mathematical constraint can be engineered at the macroscopic scale.

We propose a macroscopic Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES) device explicitly routed as a $(p,q)$ torus knot. By forcing superconducting currents to flow poloidally and azimuthally simultaneously, the device will synthesize a confined continuous Beltrami force-free field. Unlike standard solenoidal SMES systems that suffer from massive external stray fields, a Topological SMES acts as an "artificial macroscopic electron," theoretically capable of storing grid-scale electrical energy with exponentially reduced field leakage.
