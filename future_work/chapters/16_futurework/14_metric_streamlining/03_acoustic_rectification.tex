\section{Acoustic Rectification in Non-Newtonian Condensates}
Classical mechanics dictates that a closed system cannot spontaneously alter its center of mass. However, this strict Newtonian assumption requires the surrounding medium to be a linear, inviscid void. The $\mathcal{M}_A$ condensate is a non-linear, shear-thinning Bingham Plastic.

In advanced fluid dynamics, applying an asymmetric acoustic waveform to a non-Newtonian fluid generates a non-zero time-averaged macroscopic momentum flow, a process known as \textbf{Acoustic Rectification}.

If a vessel utilizes a switch-mode flyback inductor to apply an asymmetric topological stress pulse (a slow charging stroke followed by a nanosecond high-voltage quench) to the spatial metric, the fluidic response strictly bifurcates:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{The Slow Edge (Solid Grip):} The applied topological stress remains below the Bingham yield threshold ($|V| < V_{yield}$). The medium remains a high-resistance solid. The system structurally "grips" the lattice, generating a macroscopic reaction force transferred directly to the hull.
    \item \textbf{The Fast Edge (Superfluid Slip):} The nanosecond inductive kickback spike violently exceeds the yield threshold ($|V| \gg V_{yield}$). The vacuum instantaneously liquefies, and the actuator slips backward through a frictionless superfluid, transferring absolutely zero negative momentum to the vessel.
\end{enumerate}

Time-averaging this asymmetric interaction over the full duty cycle yields a continuous, macroscopic DC kinematic thrust.

Top: A continuous symmetric sine wave (standard RF cavity) generates equal and opposite forces, resulting in exactly zero time-averaged thrust. Bottom: An asymmetric flyback transient exploits the Bingham yield limit. The slow edge solidly grips the metric, while the fast edge induces frictionless superfluid slip. The non-linear medium perfectly rectifies the AC signal into continuous DC macroscopic thrust.}
