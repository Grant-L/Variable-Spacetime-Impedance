\section{Deterministic Interference: The Pilot Wave and Lattice Memory}
\label{sec:pilot_wave}

If the vacuum is a physically connected mechanical substance, then a moving topological particle must create a hydrodynamic pressure wake. We model "Quantum Probability" not as a metaphysical dice roll, but as the deterministic interaction of a particle with the \textbf{Lattice Memory} of the manifold.

\subsection{Interference Without Superposition}
In the Double Slit Experiment, the particle never physically passes through both slits.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The topological defect (particle) passes through Slit A.
    \item The hydrodynamic spatial pressure wake generated by its motion passes through \textit{both} Slits A and B.
    \item The continuous pressure wave geometrically interferes with itself on the far side of the barrier.
    \item Upon exiting Slit A, the particle is subjected to the ponderomotive force of the resulting transverse pressure gradients ($\mathbf{F} \propto \nabla |\Psi|^2$).
    \item The particle deterministically "surfs" the gradients into the quantized standing-wave troughs (see Figure \ref{fig:double_slit_decoherence}).
\end{enumerate}
This seamlessly reproduces the statistical interference distribution of Quantum Mechanics ($|\Psi|^2$) purely via classical fluid dynamics on the solid substrate, completely removing the mystical necessity for localized particles to exist in spatial superposition.

\subsection{Resolving Bell's Inequality: Non-Local Constraint Realism}
A standard critique of "Hidden Variable" pilot-wave theories is their violation of Bell's Inequalities. However, Bell's Theorem only rules out \textit{Local} variables. It explicitly permits \textbf{Non-Local Realism}.

In the AVE framework, the deterministic hidden variable is identically the instantaneous, continuous stress tensor ($\sigma_{ij}$) of the entire $\mathcal{M}_A$ manifold. Because the lattice is a globally connected solid, altering the impedance boundary conditions at Detector A (a measurement setting) inherently restructures the global static solution to the elliptic Poisson equation across the entire network. The non-locality arises because entangled particles traverse a solid substrate that is \textit{already} globally pre-tensioned by the physical configuration of both detectors.
