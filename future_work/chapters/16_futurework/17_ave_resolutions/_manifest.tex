\chapter{Modern Crises in Physics: The AVE Resolutions}
\label{ch:modern_crises}

In the 2020s, the Standard Model of particle physics and the $\Lambda$CDM model of cosmology are violently cracking under the weight of new, high-precision observational data. Orthodox physics attempts to patch these cracks by inventing increasingly desperate mathematical ghosts: dark matter, dark energy, composite fermions, and unshieldable cosmic rays.

As engineers, we reject invisible parameters. If the Applied Vacuum Engineering (AVE) framework is the correct description of the universe, it must organically predict these modern anomalies using \textbf{only its established hardware limits} (The $\mathcal{M}_A$ discrete grid, the $60$ kV Bingham Yield, the kinematic viscosity, and Cosserat Transverse elasticity).
