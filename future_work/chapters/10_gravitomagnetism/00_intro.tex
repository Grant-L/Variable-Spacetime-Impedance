\section{Introduction}
If inertial mass is fundamentally generated by the localized back-EMF of single spinning electromagnetic standing waves, then a massive macroscopic object (such as a rapidly rotating planet or the Sagnac-RLVE centrifuge) is simply a colossal, translating cluster of these bound inductive loops.

According to classical electrodynamics applied to the LC resonant $\mathcal{M}_A$ vacuum, this massive spinning cluster physically creates a macroscopic secondary phase shift in the surrounding localized network via \textbf{Mutual Inductance}. This chapter aims to mathematically map exactly how the collective magnetic flux of atomic loops electrically biases the local vacuum impedance ($Z_{vac}$). This physically re-derives "Frame Dragging" (Lense-Thirring effect) from an abstract geometric coordinate transformation into literal electromagnetic induction induced by spinning magnetic dipoles acting on the continuous optical metric.
