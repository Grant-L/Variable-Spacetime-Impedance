\section{Introduction}
If inertial mass is fundamentally generated by the localized back-EMF of single spinning flywheels, then a massive macroscopic object (such as a rapidly rotating planet or the Sagnac-RLVE centrifuge) is simply a colossal, translating cluster of these bound flywheels.

According to the Navier-Stokes formulations applied to the Bingham-plastic $\mathcal{M}_A$ vacuum, this massive translating cluster physically drags the surrounding localized fluid via non-linear boundary layer friction. This chapter aims to mathematically map exactly how the collective angular momentum of atomic flywheels mechanically shears the local vacuum ($G_{vac}$). This physically re-derives "Frame Dragging" (Lense-Thirring effect) from an abstract geometric coordinate transformation into literal fluidic boundary-layer drag induced by spinning rotors acting on the continuous spatial metric.
