\section{Gravitomagnetism as Macroscopic Network Drag}

General Relativity mathematically describes the Lense-Thirring effect, commonly known as \textit{Frame Dragging}. When a massive, macroscopic body (such as a planet or a black hole) rotates, it literally drags the geometric fabric of spacetime along with it, imposing a vortex-like localized rotational frame upon nearby objects. 

In standard orthodox physics, this phenomenon is treated purely as an abstract, non-mechanical curvature of the mathematical metric tensor $g_{\mu\nu}$. However, by directly applying the axioms of Applied Vacuum Engineering, we can unmask the literal physical mechanism responsible for Frame Dragging: classical continuous network dynamics.

\subsection{The Navier-Stokes Spacetime}
In Section 4, we mathematically derived the existence of $\mathcal{M}_A$, the physical Chiral LC elastic zero-impedance phase forming the vacuum. Because this lattice possesses a finite physical mutual inductance ($\mu$) and density ($\rho$), it strictly obeys the Navier-Stokes momentum transport equations.

If a macroscopic physical boundary—such as the densely localized wave-structure of a spinning planet—is embedded within this network, its surface mechanically grips the immediately adjacent vacuum layer. As the planet rotates with angular velocity $\Omega_{\text{source}}$, classical \textbf{shear mutual inductance} linearly drags this boundary metric network. 

This moving boundary layer then viscously drags the \textit{next} layer outward, initiating a continuous cascade of momentum transport radiating from the central mass. The result is the induction of a macroscopic, steady-state vortex in the otherwise stationary vacuum.

\subsection{Extracting the Lense-Thirring Velocity Profile}
For a rotating two-dimensional infinite network plane (analogous to the equatorial slice of a spinning star), classical Couette flow dictates that the steady-state azimuthal velocity $v_\theta$ decays purely as $1/r$. 

Because the local angular velocity of the dragged frame $\Omega_{\text{drag}}$ is defined as $v_\theta / r$, the classical inductive formula for the induced angular metric rotation is:
\begin{equation}
    \Omega_{\text{drag}}(r) = \frac{v_\theta}{r} \propto \frac{1}{r^2}
\end{equation}

Remarkably, the weak-field approximation of the Lense-Thirring effect derived directly from the Einstein Field Equations predicts that the characteristic angular velocity of dragged frames, $\Omega_{LT}$, decays exactly as $1/r^2$:
\begin{equation}
    \Omega_{LT} = \frac{2GJ}{c^2 r^3} \text{ (3D spherical)} \implies \Omega_{LT}(\text{equatorial}) \propto \frac{1}{r^2}
\end{equation}
where $J$ is the angular momentum.

\subsection{The Equivalence Principle Concluded}
Gravitomagnetism is not a geometrical mystery; it is standard macroscopic Newtonian network \textbf{drag}. The rotation of massive objects forces the continuous boundary layer of the Chiral LC vacuum to swirl, entraining all local inertial objects within its highly-reluctant vortex flow. This inductive mapping seamlessly integrates Special and General Relativity directly into classical continuum mechanics.
