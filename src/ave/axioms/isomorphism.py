Axiom 2: The Topo-Kinematic Isomorphism
========================================
Charge q is defined identically as a discrete geometric dislocation
within the M_A electromagnetic network. Therefore, the fundamental
dimension of charge is strictly identical to length: [Q] ≡ [L].

The macroscopic scaling is rigidly defined by the Topological Conversion
Constant:
    ξ_topo ≡ e / ℓ_node   [Coulombs / Meter]

This module provides exact dimensional conversion functions between
electrical and mechanical domains.
