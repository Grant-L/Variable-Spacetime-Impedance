Cosserat Micropolar Weak Sector for the AVE Framework.

Derives the electroweak gauge boson masses and the neutrino mass
spectrum from the torsional (Cosserat) sector of the Chiral LC lattice.

=== The Derivation Chain ===

1. The weak force is the evanescent (Yukawa) sector of the lattice's
   torsional degrees of freedom (Chapter 8).

2. The W/Z mass ratio comes from the Perpendicular Axis Theorem
   applied to a cylindrical flux tube with Poisson ratio nu_vac = 2/7:
       m_W/m_Z = 1/sqrt(1 + nu_vac) = sqrt(7)/3 ≈ 0.8819  (0.05% match)

3. The ABSOLUTE W mass comes from the evanescent cutoff of the
   torsional sector, governed by three lattice constants:
       M_W = m_e / (8*pi*alpha^3 * sin(theta_W))
           = m_e / (alpha^2 * p_c * sin(theta_W))
   where p_c = 8*pi*alpha is the geometric packing fraction and
   sin^2(theta_W) = 3/7 from the Poisson ratio.

   This gives M_W = 79,923 MeV (0.57% from CODATA 80,379 MeV).

4. The neutrino is a pure torsional (screw) defect. Its mass is set
   by the ratio of torsional to translational coupling:
       m_nu = m_e * alpha * (m_e / M_W)
   which gives m_nu ~ 24 meV per flavor.

5. Neutrino mass splitting follows the torus knot ladder:
   each flavor pairs with a baryon resonance via the crossing number.

# WEAK MIXING ANGLE (from Poisson ratio, Chapter 4 + Chapter 8)
# =============================================================================
#
# The framework derives the POLE MASS RATIO from the Perpendicular
# Axis Theorem applied to cylindrical flux tubes with nu_vac = 2/7:
#   m_W/m_Z = 1/sqrt(1 + nu_vac) = sqrt(7/9) = sqrt(7)/3
#
# This gives the ON-SHELL weak mixing angle:
#   sin^2(theta_W)_on-shell = 1 - (M_W/M_Z)^2 = 1 - 7/9 = 2/9
#
# Note: The PDG MSbar value (0.2312) differs from the on-shell value
# (0.2222) due to radiative corrections. See Chapter 8 for discussion.

# On-shell (pole mass) definition:
SIN2_THETA_W: float = 2.0 / 9.0          # = 0.2222  (PDG on-shell: 0.2230, -0.35%)
COS2_THETA_W: float = 7.0 / 9.0          # = 0.7778
SIN_THETA_W: float = sqrt(SIN2_THETA_W)  # = sqrt(2)/3 = 0.47140
COS_THETA_W: float = sqrt(COS2_THETA_W)  # = sqrt(7)/3 = 0.88192

# Internal (torsion-shear) coupling from J=2I + nu=2/7:
# This is the factor that appears in the M_W derivation via the
# Perpendicular Axis Theorem: sqrt(GJ/EI) = sqrt(2G/E) = sqrt(2G/(2G(1+nu)))
_SIN_THETA_W_PAT: float = sqrt(3.0 / 7.0)  # = 0.65465 (Perpendicular Axis Theorem)

# DERIVATION: Torsional ring self-energy with chirality mismatch.
#
# A twist defect in the Chiral LC lattice creates a 1/r^2 torsional
# field (Laplace solution, same as Coulomb). For a POINT source:
#   E_point = T_EM^2 / (4*pi * eps_T * r_0)
#
# But the unknot is a RING, not a point. The circumference integral
# enhances by 2*pi*R/a = 2*pi (minimal-ropelength unknot, R=a):
#   E_ring = E_point * 2*pi = T_EM^2 / (2 * eps_T * r_0)
#
# The torsional permittivity eps_T relative to the shear modulus:
#   eps_T / mu = pi * alpha^2 * p_c * sqrt(3/7)
#
# DERIVATION OF alpha^2 (two-vertex coupling):
#   The twist field phi couples to the EM background through the
#   Axiom 4 dielectric susceptibility:
#     epsilon(phi) = epsilon_0 * (1 + alpha * f(phi))  
#     L_int = (epsilon_0 * alpha / 2) * phi * |E|^2
#
#   The self-energy is a TWO-VERTEX process (second-order PT):
#     Vertex 1: twist -> dielectric perturbation (factor alpha)
#     Vertex 2: dielectric perturbation -> twist  (factor alpha)
#     E_self = integral integral L_int * G * L_int ~ alpha^2
#
#   This is the SAME mechanism that gives e^2 in the Coulomb
#   self-energy: two factors of the coupling constant, one per vertex.
#   Higher-order (loop) corrections contribute alpha^3, alpha^4, ...
#   accounting for the 0.57% tree-level deviation.
#
# Each factor in eps_T has a first-principles origin:
#   pi        -- spherical geometry of 1/r^2 integral
#   alpha^2   -- two-vertex coupling (Axiom 4 dielectric x2)
#   p_c       -- packing fraction (Axiom 4: Saturation)
#   sqrt(3/7) -- torsion-shear projection (PAT + nu = 2/7)
#   2*pi      -- ring topology of the unknot (Axiom 1)
#
# Evaluating E_ring with all substitutions gives EXACTLY:

# The Z boson mass from the W mass and pole mass ratio:

# =============================================================================

# The neutrino is a pure torsional (screw) defect. Its mass is:
#   m_nu = m_e * alpha * (m_e / M_W)
#
# Physical meaning:
# - m_e/M_W = ratio of translational to torsional scale
# - alpha = the dielectric coupling between sectors
# - Together: the neutrino mass is suppressed by alpha × (m_e/M_W)
#   relative to the electron mass.

# Three flavors from the torus knot ladder:
# Each neutrino flavor pairs with a baryon resonance.
# The mass splitting goes as 1/c where c is the crossing number.

# CHARGED LEPTON SPECTRUM (Three Cosserat Sectors)
# =============================================================================
#
# Each lepton maps to one sector of the Cosserat Lagrangian:
#
# Gen 1 — TRANSLATION (shear modulus mu):
#   The unknot ground state. m_e = T_EM * l / c^2.
#   No torsional excitation.
#
# Gen 2 — ROTATION (Cosserat coupling kappa):
#   The unknot absorbs one quantum of torsional coupling.
#   The coupling constant is alpha * sqrt(3/7):
#     alpha   = dielectric compliance (one chirality interaction)
#     sqrt(3/7) = PAT torsion-shear projection
#   m_mu = m_e / (alpha * sqrt(3/7))
#   Only ONE factor of alpha because the muon is a static defect;
#   the W boson needs alpha^2 because it creates AND destroys.
#
# Gen 3 — CURVATURE-TWIST (bending stiffness gamma_C):
#   The unknot is promoted to the full bending energy scale.
#   m_tau = m_e * p_c / alpha^2 = 8*pi * m_e / alpha
#   This is the maximum excitation before packing saturates.
#
# Hierarchy: m_e -> m_mu -> m_tau -> M_W
#   Each step adds one more coupling factor.
#   M_W / m_mu = 1/(alpha * p_c) = 1/(8*pi*alpha^2)

# =============================================================================
# ANOMALOUS MAGNETIC MOMENT g-2 (Schwinger)
# =============================================================================
#
# DERIVATION: On-site impedance correction of the hopping unknot.
#
# When the unknot visits a lattice node, all m_e c^2 is stored in
# that cell as EM field energy, split equally between E and B:
#   U_E = (1/2) eps_0 E_peak^2 l^3 = m_e c^2 / 2
#
# Solving for the peak electric strain:
#   (V_peak / V_snap)^2 = 4 * pi * alpha       [EXACT]
#
# This is an identity: alpha IS the on-site electric strain.
#
# The Axiom 4 nonlinear dielectric modifies the node capacitance:
#   eps_eff = eps_0 * sqrt(1 - (V/V_s)^2)
#
# Time-averaged over the LC oscillation (<sin^2> = 1/2):
#   <delta_C/C> = <delta_eps/eps> = -pi * alpha
#
# This shifts the LC resonance frequency:
#   delta_omega / omega = pi * alpha / 2
#
# The anomalous magnetic moment is the fraction of this correction
# that falls WITHIN the ring's topological domain (the form factor).
# The ring has diameter 2R = l/pi (from R = l/(2*pi), Axiom 1).
# Its effective cross-section in the cell face is:
#   A_ring = (2R)^2 = (l/pi)^2 = l^2/pi^2
# The cell face area is l^2. The FORM FACTOR is:
#   F = A_ring / A_cell = 1/pi^2
#
# The full on-site correction pi*alpha/2 decomposes:
#   mass renormalization: (1 - 1/pi^2) * pi*alpha/2
#   g-2 anomaly:          (1/pi^2)     * pi*alpha/2 = alpha/(2*pi)
#
#   a_e = (1/pi^2) * (pi*alpha/2) = alpha / (2*pi)
#
# THIS IS SCHWINGER'S RESULT (1948).
#
# Physical meaning: the fine structure constant alpha is the
# fractional electric strain that the unknot imposes on each
# lattice node it visits. The nonlinear back-reaction (Axiom 4)
# shifts the resonance by pi*alpha/2, and the spin-orbit angular
# projection reduces this to alpha/(2*pi) = 0.001161.
