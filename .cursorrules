# Cursor Rules for Applied Vacuum Engineering Project

## Project Context
This is a theoretical physics research project exploring novel concepts in spacetime dynamics. The codebase uses Python, Jupyter notebooks, and scientific computing libraries.

## Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use descriptive variable names, especially for physical quantities
- Include units in comments when relevant (e.g., `# meters`, `# seconds`)
- Prefer NumPy/SciPy for numerical computations
- Use SymPy for symbolic mathematics

## Notebook Conventions
- Start notebooks with markdown cells explaining purpose and theory
- Use markdown cells to separate sections
- Keep code cells focused and well-commented
- Document assumptions and approximations
- Include references to relevant papers/theory

## Physics-Specific Guidelines
- Always use physical constants from `scipy.constants` or `src/constants.py`
- Be explicit about coordinate systems and conventions
- Document dimensional analysis
- Include error estimates where relevant
- Use appropriate precision for calculations

## File Organization
- Notebooks go in `notebooks/` directory
- Reusable code goes in `src/` directory
- Data files go in `data/` directory
- Results go in `results/` directory

## Git Workflow
- Commit notebooks frequently
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Don't commit large data files (use .gitignore)
- Keep working tree clean
