Because a discrete lattice cannot stretch macroscopically without disrupting its Delaunay triangulation, metric expansion is modeled strictly as the **Discrete Crystallization** of new topological nodes.\n",

    "\n",
    "We hypothesize that the Hubble Constant ($H_0$) is not a velocity, but the **Lattice Crystallization Rate** required to maintain the vacuum's structural integrity against the compressive tension of gravity. Integrating the Machian boundary impedance derived in Chapter 4 against the quantum mass-gap yields the absolute asymptotic expansion limit:\n",
