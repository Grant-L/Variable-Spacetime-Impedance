# AVE Physics Verification: Macroscopic Relativity

## 1. The Optical Metric Derivation
Standard General Relativity requires a curved 4D manifold. AVE derives the same observational results using a 3D Trace-Reversed Cosserat Solid with variable refractive density.

* **Vacuum Poisson Ratio:** $\nu = 2/7$ (Derived from Over-Bracing)
* **Transverse Coupling:** $h_{\perp} = \nu \cdot \chi_{vol} = (2/7) \cdot 7\Phi = 2\Phi$
* **Resulting Refractive Index:** $n(r) = 1 + 2GM/c^2r$

## 2. Lensing Verification
Ray-tracing simulations confirm that this refractive index yields a deflection angle of:
$$ \delta = \frac{4GM}{bc^2} $$
This exactly matches the **Einstein Deflection** observed in the 1919 Eddington experiment, distinguishing it from the Newtonian corpuscular prediction ($2GM/bc^2$).

## 3. Black Hole Topology
The Event Horizon is identified not as a coordinate singularity, but as a **Dielectric Breakdown Boundary**.
* **Breakdown Condition:** Metric Strain $\ge 100\%$
* **Derived Radius:** $R_{rupture} = 2GM/c^2$
* **Physical Implication:** Inside the horizon, the vacuum lattice exceeds its elastic yield point and undergoes a phase transition into a continuous, unstructured plasma (Information Loss).

## 4. Conclusion
Macroscopic Gravity is rigorously unified with the microscopic lattice via the **Optical Metric**. The "Curvature of Spacetime" is physically isomorphic to the "Refractive Gradient of the Cosserat Vacuum."
