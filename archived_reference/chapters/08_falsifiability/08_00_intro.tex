\section{The Universal Kill Signals}
\label{sec:kill_signals}

The VSI Framework is a vulnerable theory. Unlike string theory, which often operates at energy scales inaccessible to experimentation, SVF makes specific, testable predictions about the hardware limits of the vacuum.

Its validity rests on the following falsification thresholds:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{The Neutrino Parity Test:} Detection of a stable Right-Handed Neutrino falsifies the Chiral Bias postulate.
    \item \textbf{The Nyquist Limit:} Detection of any signal with $\nu > \omega_{sat}$ (Trans-Planckian) proves the vacuum is a continuum, killing the discrete manifold model.
    \item \textbf{The Metric Null-Result:} If local impedance modification fails to produce refractive delays (Shapiro delay) in the lab, the Engineering Layer is falsified.
\end{enumerate}
