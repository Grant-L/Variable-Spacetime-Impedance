\section{Introduction: Beyond the Boson}
\label{sec:weak_intro}

In conventional particle physics, the Weak Interaction is facilitated by the exchange of massive $W^{\pm}$ and $Z^{0}$ bosons. The \textbf{Stochastic Vacuum Framework (SVF)} proposes that these are not fundamental particles, but emergent \textbf{Transient Impedance Spikes}.

Instead of a "force" mediated by a carrier particle, we model the Weak Interaction as the momentary mechanical resistance of the $M_A$ substrate to high-frequency, chiral topological twists.

When a particle's internal helicity opposes the vacuum's intrinsic grain ($\mathbf{\Omega}_{vac}$), the local node impedance spikes toward infinity ($Z \to \infty$). This results in the short-range "damping" characteristic of the Weak Force.
