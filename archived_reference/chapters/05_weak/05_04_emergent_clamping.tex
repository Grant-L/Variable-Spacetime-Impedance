\section{Simulation: Emergent Clamping}
\label{sec:chiral_simulation}

To verify the Chiral Bias postulate, we modeled the propagation of two signal polarities through the $M_A$ substrate using the \texttt{WeakInteractionSim} module. The simulation demonstrates that the "broken symmetry" of the Weak Interaction is actually a \textbf{Chiral High-Pass Filter}.

    \caption{\textbf{The Chiral Exclusion Principle (Simulation Result).} 
    \textbf{Green (Left-Handed):} The signal ($h=-1$) aligns with the vacuum bias ($\Omega_{vac}$), encountering baseline impedance $Z_0$. It propagates freely. 
    \textbf{Red (Right-Handed):} The signal ($h=+1$) opposes the bias, triggering an impedance spike ($Z \to \infty$). The wave hits the "Impedance Wall" and undergoes immediate evanescent decay. This confirms that the absence of Right-Handed neutrinos is a hardware filtering effect.}

Any right-handed twist is damped out by the Back-EMF of the manifold before it can propagate beyond a single lattice pitch ($l_P$). This effectively renders the Right-Handed Neutrino "massively unstable" (infinite effective mass), removing it from the observable low-energy spectrum without requiring arbitrary symmetry breaking.
