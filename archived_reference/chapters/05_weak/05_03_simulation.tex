\subsection{5.5 Simulation: The Chiral High-Pass Filter}
To verify the mechanical origin of Parity Violation, we modeled the propagation of chiral signals through the $M_A$ substrate using the \texttt{WeakInteractionSim\_v3} physics engine.

The simulation implements the \textbf{Chiral Damping Law}, where the local lattice impedance $Z$ is a function of the alignment between the signal helicity $h$ and the vacuum grain $\Omega_{vac}$:
\begin{equation}
    \Gamma_{damping}(x) = \Gamma_{max} \cdot \max(0, h \cdot \Omega_{vac}(x))
\end{equation}

\textbf{Results:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Left-Handed ($h=-1$):} The signal aligns with the vacuum grain ($h \cdot \Omega_{vac} = -1$). The damping term vanishes ($\Gamma = 0$), allowing the neutrino to propagate freely as a stable soliton.
    \item \textbf{Right-Handed ($h=+1$):} The signal opposes the vacuum grain ($h \cdot \Omega_{vac} = +1$). The damping term activates ($\Gamma = \Gamma_{max}$), creating an infinite impedance wall that blocks propagation within one lattice pitch ($l_P$).
\end{itemize}

    \caption{\textbf{The Chiral Exclusion Principle.} Simulation results demonstrate that the "Weak Force" is effectively a Chiral High-Pass Filter. The vacuum hardware is transparent to Left-Handed twists (Green) but opaque to Right-Handed twists (Red), mechanically enforcing the Standard Model's parity violation.}
