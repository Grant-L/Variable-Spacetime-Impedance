# Lindblom Coupling Theory (LCT) Project

This repository structures the development, simulation, and documentation of the Lindblom Coupling Theory (LCT). It uses JupyterLab notebooks for interactive exploration, derivations, and simulations. The project is designed for use with Cursor AI editor for enhanced coding, but can be opened in any Jupyter environment.

## Structure

- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for step-by-step derivations, simulations, and analysis.
- **docs/**: Documentation, paper drafts, and abstracts.
- **src/**: Python scripts and modules for reusable functions (e.g., lattice simulations).
- **data/**: Datasets, simulation outputs, and external data (e.g., SPARC galaxy data).
- **simulations/**: Specific simulation scripts and results.

## Setup

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Lindblom-Coupling-Theory.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open in Cursor or JupyterLab: `jupyter lab`
