## Overview

Theoretical physics has reached a juncture where the mathematical complexity of our models has outpaced our mechanical understanding. This text and repository proposes a return to hardware: treating the vacuum not as a geometric abstraction, but as a **Discrete Amorphous Manifold ($M_A$)**.

The central thesis of this work is that the vacuum is a physical substrate governed by finite inductive and capacitive densities. By redefining the fundamental constants of nature as the bulk engineering properties of this substrate, we move from a descriptive physics to an operational one.

### Project Components
