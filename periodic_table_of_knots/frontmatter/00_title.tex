\noindent\textbf{Periodic Table of Knots: Topological Structures of the Elements} \\
This document presents a comprehensive analysis of the topological knot structures underlying each element in the periodic table, including speculative elements beyond the currently known table.

\begin{abstract}
    The Periodic Table of Knots explores the topological structures that define each chemical element from a knot-theoretic perspective. This work examines how the fundamental knot topology of each element relates to its physical and chemical properties.
    
    Each element entry includes:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Knot Topology:} The fundamental knot structure characterizing the element.
        \item \textbf{Topological Invariants:} Mathematical properties derived from knot theory.
        \item \textbf{Physical Properties:} How knot topology relates to observed element behavior.
        \item \textbf{Computational Simulations:} Numerical analysis of knot structures and dynamics.
    \end{itemize}
    
    This document covers all 118 confirmed elements plus speculative elements up to element 180, providing a complete topological framework for understanding the periodic table through the lens of knot theory.
