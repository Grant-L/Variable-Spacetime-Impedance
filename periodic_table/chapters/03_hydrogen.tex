\section{Topological Structure and Isotope Stability}
The simplest possible atomic state consists of a singular $6^3_2$ Borromean proton defect anchored by the $3_1$ trefoil electron defect orbiting its refractive gravity well. 

The addition of a neutron ($6^3_2 + \text{axial twist}$) geometrically links with the proton, forming a heavily anisotropic "dumbbell" defect. This significantly alters the local spatial drag and acoustic cross-section, forming Deuterium ($^2H$).

If a third defect is added (Tritium, $^3H$), the topological strain of interlocking three $6^3_2$ defects forces the overall knot into a state of severe internal mechanical tension, spontaneously unraveling (beta decaying) to stabilize the local topology.

\section{Electrical Engineering Equivalent: The Coupled Tank}

\section{Topological Area of Interest: Stellar Compression \& S-Parameters}
When analyzing the Protium $^1H$ topology purely as an EE Resonant Tank, its exceptionally small geometrical footprint translates directly into an exceedingly small $S_{11}$ scattering cross-section ($2.27 d^2$). 

In practical applied physics, this explains why initiating Hydrogen fusion requires such staggering pressure and temperature (e.g., the core of a star, or a Tokamak reactor). Because the $S_{11}$ cross-section is so compact, the probability of two autonomous Protium tanks successfully colliding their continuous metric fields to induce an inductive topological merge (fusion) is statistically poor without massive kinetic confinement forcing their boundaries to overlap.
