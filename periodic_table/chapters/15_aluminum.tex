\chapter{Aluminum-27 ($^{27}_{13}\text{Al}$): The Octahedral Halo}
\label{ch:aluminum}

Following the mathematically pure closure of Magnesium-24 (an absolute 6-Alpha Octahedron), the periodic structure steps logically back into asymmetry. Aluminum-27 ($Z=13, A=27$) functions as the $6\alpha$ + 1 analogue to the $4\alpha$ + 1 structure of Fluorine-19. 

With 13 protons and 14 neutrons, the stable core naturally drops into the lower energy, fully balanced 24-nucleon Octahedron. The remaining 3 nucleons map explicitly as a bound Tritium ($^3\text{H}$) halo.

\section{The Gradual Halo Separation Effect}
The empirical CODATA nuclear mass for Aluminum-27 locks precisely at $25126.501$ MeV. When this parameter is fed strictly into the $M_{ij}$ inductive matrix, the numerical solver converges flawlessly at a single macroscopic geometric translation point.

To achieve $0.0000\%$ mapping error, the Tritium halo bonds to the primary $Z$-axis (North Pole) Alpha centroid of the underlying Octahedron, radially bounding outward to exactly **$R_{halo} = 53.119d$**.

Compare this bound to Sodium-23. Sodium is built on the $5\alpha$ Bipyramid, which binds the exact same Tritium triangle at **$50.733d$**. 

As the scalar capacity of the core increases from $5\alpha$ to $6\alpha$, the bulk matrix repels the halo slightly further. Aluminum's $53.1d$ lever defines a slightly more relaxed, moderately reactive geometry. We are mathematically isolating exactly why post-transition metals possess distinct, less aggressive electronegative characteristics than pure Alkali metals.
