\section{Lithium-6 and Lithium-7}
Progressing past the closed, highly stable spherical geometry of Helium-4, Lithium forces the graph to initiate a second topological structural layer. The addition of the 3rd proton heavily polarizes the knot's acoustic drag perimeter.

By topological necessity, the Lithium-7 ($^7Li$) nucleus consists of a deeply bound inner core and a much looser outer secondary shell.

\subsection{The Alpha Core and Secondary Shell}
The geometric framework of $^7Li$ builds directly upon the symmetry of the preceding element. The core remains a tightly interlocked tetrahedral Alpha particle (2 protons, 2 neutrons). However, the lattice voids (interstitial sites) on the exterior facies of this core serve as the docking points for the next sequence of nucleons.

To form $^7Li$, one additional proton and two additional neutrons bind to these exterior lattice voids. Because the strong internal shielding of the Alpha particle repels deep penetration, this secondary shell orbits at approximately twice the radial offset of the core nucleons, rendering Lithium highly reactive and significantly less structurally stable than Helium.

\section{Dual-Shell Vacuum Density Profiles}
The dual-shell structural nature of Lithium becomes explicitly visible when plotting the resultant macroscopic vacuum scalar density field (refractive strain).

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:li7_density_equator}, the topological strain field of Lithium-7 is heavily skewed. The flux gradients (arrows) do not point to a unified symmetrical center of mass; they warp dramatically to accommodate the isolated outer proton and neutrons. This topological asymmetry directly governs the classical chemical and nuclear properties of the element.

\section{Electrical Engineering Equivalent: Air-Core Transformer}
Due to the vast spatial separation ($R_{outer} \approx 9.72d$) between the tight continuous Alpha core and the loose outer nucleons, Lithium-7 acts conceptually exactly like an \textbf{Air-Core Transformer} with a low coupling coefficient ($k$).

The inner $^4He$ Alpha core acts as the highly efficient, tightly-wound Primary Coil. The distant 3-nucleon outer shell acts as the loosely-coupled Secondary Coil. Because the spatial separation is so immense relative to the core scale, the topological mutual inductance ($M_{shell} \propto 1/9.72d$) binding the shell to the core is fragile. 

This low mutual inductance physically explains why the Lithium outer shell is easily stripped away in chemical reactions and stellar fusion environments, while the primary core (the Alpha particle) remains perfectly preserved and inductively secure.
