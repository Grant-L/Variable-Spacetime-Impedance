\section{The Squared Dielectric Saturation Limit}
As established in Axiom 4, the effective compliance of the spatial substrate is geometrically bounded by the fine-structure limit ($\alpha$). The exact varactor scaling is defined as:

$$C_{eff}(\Delta\phi) = \frac{C_0}{\sqrt{1 - (\frac{\Delta\phi}{\alpha})^2}}$$

Integrating this compliance to define the non-linear displacement field ($D_{NL}$) yields a strict analytical prediction for the 3rd-order optical Kerr effect ($\chi^{(3)}$), completely independent of perturbative virtual-pair summations.
