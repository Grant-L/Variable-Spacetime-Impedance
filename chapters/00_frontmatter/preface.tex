\section*{A Note to the Reader}

This book is intended for those who have found the mathematical abstractions of modern field theory—strings, multiverses, and probabilistic collapse—insufficient to describe a physical, mechanical reality. The \LCT{} (LCT) provides a pathway back to a constitutive universe where physics is not an abstraction, but an emergent property of hardware.

As you progress through the layers—from the \textbf{Hardware Layer} (Chapter 1) to the \textbf{Engineering Layer} (Chapter 8)—keep in mind that every equation is a description of a physical constraint in the vacuum lattice. The ``mysteries'' of quantum mechanics and gravity are not paradoxes to be accepted, but engineering challenges to be solved within the limits of the substrate.

This text represents a definitive departure from 20th-century geometric abstraction toward a constitutive, hardware-oriented understanding of the cosmos. By moving from the perceived continuum to a discrete hardware layer, we reveal a unified framework where the behavior of signals and defects is as predictable as any electrical transmission line.
