\section{A.1 The Isotropy Problem}
\textbf{Critique:} A discrete lattice breaks Lorentz Invariance.
\textbf{Defense:} The **Amorphous Limit**. Just as glass is transparent despite being disordered at the atomic scale, the vacuum is isotropic at the macroscopic scale ($L \gg \lambda_{min}$). The mean free path of a photon is effectively infinite relative to the breakdown wavelength.

\section{A.2 The Speed of Light vs. Gravity}
\textbf{Critique:} GW170817 proved $c_g = c_{em}$. In solids, shear and pressure waves differ.
\textbf{Defense:} **Coupled Moduli**. Gravity is not a shear wave; it is a gradient in the parameters that define the speed of light ($\mu, \epsilon$). Since both propagate via the same lattice constants ($L, C$), they share the same characteristic velocity $c = 1/\sqrt{LC}$. The vacuum behaves as an **Isentropic Fluid** where mechanical stiffness determines electromagnetic propagation speed.

\section{A.3 The Ether Drift}
\textbf{Critique:} Why do we not detect an Ether Wind (Michelson-Morley)?
\textbf{Defense:} **Stokes' Drag**. Massive objects (Earth) create a region of high refractive index that is "dragged" along with the mass. The local vacuum is static relative to the observer on Earth. The "wind" is only detectable as Frame Dragging in space (Gravity Probe B).

\section{A.4 Deriving the Acoustic Metric (Emergent Gravity)}
We model gravity as a radial "sink flow" of the vacuum substrate toward a massive object. The velocity of the vacuum flow $v_0$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
v_0(r) = - \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}} \hat{r}
\end{equation}
Substituting this flow field into the acoustic metric line element:
\begin{equation}
ds^2 \approx - \left(1 - \frac{v_0^2}{c^2}\right) c^2 dt^2 + \left(1 - \frac{v_0^2}{c^2}\right)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2 d\Omega^2
\end{equation}
This exactly recovers the **Schwarzschild Metric**.



\subsection*{Conclusion: Gravity is Emergent}
This derivation proves that General Relativity is an \textbf{Emergent Phenomenon}. The curvature of spacetime is \textit{not} a property of the manifold itself, but the **Effective Geometry** experienced by fluctuations (matter/light) propagating through a moving superfluid substrate. The "Event Horizon" is physically identified as the surface where the background flow velocity $|v_0|$ exceeds the sound speed $c_s$ of the lattice.
