\chapter{Observational Signatures: Solving the Dark Sector}

\section{Introduction: Anomalies as Clues}
The Standard Model of Cosmology ($\Lambda$CDM) faces two major crises: the nature of Dark Matter and the Hubble Tension[cite: 275]. LCT proposes that these are not due to invisible particles, but are artifacts of the vacuum's fluid dynamics[cite: 276].

\section{Dark Matter: The Vortex Lattice}
Standard Cold Dark Matter (CDM) postulates a halo of invisible particles[cite: 278]. LCT identifies the "Halo" as a region of \textbf{Quantum Turbulence} in the vacuum substrate[cite: 279].



\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The Mechanism:} The rotating galaxy drags the local vacuum[cite: 280]. However, because the vacuum is a superfluid, it cannot rotate as a rigid body[cite: 281]. Instead, it forms a quantized \textbf{Vortex Lattice} similar to an Abrikosov lattice in a Type-II superconductor[cite: 282].
    \item \textbf{Vortex Density:} The galaxy creates a dense array of microscopic vortices[cite: 283]. The energy density of this lattice acts as effective mass[cite: 284].
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Explaining Flat Rotation Curves}
A single vortex has a velocity profile $v \propto 1/r$ (Keplerian), which fails to explain galactic rotation. However, a \textbf{Vortex Lattice} creates a macroscopic "texture" where the vortex area density $n_v$ scales with the galactic stress.

\begin{equation}
v_{rot} \approx \frac{\hbar}{m} \sqrt{2\pi n_v(r)}
\label{eq:rotation}
\end{equation}

If the vacuum responds to shear stress by maintaining a constant vorticity per unit area (Quantum Turbulence equilibrium), the resulting rotation curve is flat ($v \approx const$).

\textbf{Simulation Results:} As shown in Figure \ref{fig:rotation_curve}, our simulation combines the standard Baryonic gravity (Bulge + Disk) with the LCT Vacuum Stress term. The result (Blue Line) recovers the flat rotation curve characteristic of spiral galaxies, identifying "Dark Matter" as the stored kinetic energy of the superfluid vacuum lattice.

\section{The Hubble Tension: A Vacuum Phase Transition}
LCT explains the $H_{0}$ mismatch as a \textbf{Vacuum Phase Transition} (Crystallization) at redshift $z \approx 10$, releasing latent heat (Dark Energy) that boosted late-universe expansion.

\section{Problems}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Vortex Lattice Rotation:} A galactic halo creates a vortex lattice with area density $n_{v}(r) \propto 1/r$. Show that the resulting rotational velocity profile $v_{rot}$ is constant (Flat Rotation Curve).
    \item \textbf{Lensing Asymmetry:} Calculate the time delay difference $\Delta t$ for a photon passing pro-grade vs. retro-grade through a rotating frame-dragging vortex with angular momentum $J$[cite: 299].
    \item \textbf{Hubble Mismatch:} If Early Dark Energy acted only between $z=10$ and $z=8$, how would this shift the inferred value of $H_{0}$ from the CMB peak compared to Supernovae measurements[cite: 300]?
