\section{The Vacuum as a Polarized TVS Filter}
The concept of chirality emerges naturally from the lattice structure when considering propagating topological defects (particles) and the ``backlog'' mechanism. In the framework of Lindblom Coupling Theory (LCT), the vacuum acts as a non-linear, directional impedance filter, analogous to a specialized \textbf{Polarized Transient Voltage Suppressor (TVS)}.

\subsection{Helicity and Mechanical Impedance}
A propagating particle is modeled as a helical vortex pulse moving through the vacuum lattice. This propagation induces a local metric strain referred to as the ``backlog'': compression of lattice nodes ahead of the pulse and stretching behind.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Impedance Mismatch:} The inherent handedness ($\pm k$ axial propagation, $\pm m$ winding number) defines the ``screw direction.'' When a vortex attempts to propagate against the lattice's natural bias, it encounters an extreme impedance mismatch due to the compressed forward nodes.
    \item \textbf{Slew Rate Limit:} The rate of phase twist exceeds the lattice's fundamental \textbf{Slew Rate Limit} ($\omega_{cutoff}$), acting identically to a TVS breakdown threshold.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Chirality as a Lossless Filter}
Crucially, LCT resolves the abstract nature of quantum chirality by framing parity violation as a hardware filter property, not merely an abstract quantum number.

Unlike standard dissipative components, the vacuum filter is \textbf{Lossless and Elastic}. The energy of a rejected (e.g., right-handed) topological configuration is not dissipated but stored reversibly as elastic metric strain ($\epsilon$), forcing the configuration into highly unstable or evanescent modes.

The Weak Force is thus identified as the manifestation of this **Topological Filter**: the lattice provides a low-impedance path only for the specific helical configuration (chirality) that aligns with the intrinsic directional bias established during cosmic genesis.

This mechanism perfectly explains why only left-handed neutrinos are observed—the vacuum impedance profile acts as a hardware discriminator, effectively realizing a perfectly polarized TVS that clamps and reflects all topologically incompatible configurations.
